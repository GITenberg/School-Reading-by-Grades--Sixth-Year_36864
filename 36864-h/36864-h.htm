<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The pupil who is in his sixth year at school should be able to read
quite well. He should be able to pronounce at sight and without hesitation
all new or unusual words; and when reading aloud, his tones should
be so clear, his enunciation so faultless, and his manner so agreeable
that his hearers shall listen with pleasure and shall have a ready understanding
of whatever is being read. He is now prepared to devote more
and more attention to literary criticism&mdash;that is, to the study of the
peculiarities of style which distinguish any selection, the passages which
are remarkable for their beauty, their truth, or their adaptation to the
particular purpose for which they were written. The habit should be
cultivated of looking for and enjoying the admirable qualities of any
literary production, and particularly of such productions as are generally
recognized as the classics of our language. While learning to distinguish
between good literature and that sort of writing which, properly speaking,
is not literature at all, the pupil's acquaintance with books is enlarged
and extended. He learns to know what are the best books and why
they are so considered; and he acquires some knowledge of the lives of
the best authors and of the circumstances under which certain of their
works were produced.</p>

<p>The present volume is designed to aid the learner in the acquisition of
all these ends. The selections are of a highly interesting character, and
illustrate almost every variety of English composition. To assist in their
comprehension, many of the selections are introduced or followed by
brief historical or bibliographical notes. Hints also are given as to collateral,
or supplementary readings on a variety of subjects. To assist the
pupil still further to enlarge his acquaintance with books and authors,
additional notes, literary and biographical, are given in the appendix;
here also may be found several pages of brief notes explanatory of difficult
passages, unusual expressions, and historical references, such as
might otherwise be stumbling stones in the way of the learner. The
numerous portraits of authors is another important feature designed to
add to the interest and beauty of the book, and to assist the pupil to a
more intimate acquaintance with the makers of our literature. Most of
the full-page pictures are reproductions of famous paintings, and these,
while serving as illustrations of the text which they accompany, are
designed to introduce the learner to some of the masters of art also, and
perform the more important office of cultivating and enlarging his æsthetic
tastes and sympathies.</p>

<h1>SCHOOL READING.</h1>
<h2>SIXTH YEAR.</h2>


<hr />
<h2>TWO WAYS OF TELLING A STORY.</h2>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Who is this? A careless little midshipman, idling
about in a great city, with his pockets full of money.</p>

<p>He is waiting for the coach: it comes up presently,
and he gets on the top of it, and looks about him.</p>

<p>They soon leave the chimney pots behind them; his
eyes wander with delight over the harvest fields, he
smells the honeysuckle in the hedgerow, and he wishes
he was down among the hazel bushes, that he might
strip them of the milky nuts; then he sees a great wain
piled up with barley, and he wishes he was seated on the
top of it; then they go through a little wood, and he
likes to see the checkered shadows of the trees lying
across the white road; and then a squirrel runs up a
bough, and he can not forbear to whoop and halloo,
though he can not chase it to its nest.</p>

<p>The other passengers are delighted with his simplicity
and childlike glee; and they encourage him to talk to
them about the sea and ships, especially Her Majesty's
ship "The Asp," wherein he has the honor to sail. In the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
jargon of the sea, he describes her many perfections, and
enlarges on her peculiar advantages; he then confides to
them how a certain middy, having been ordered to the
masthead as a punishment, had seen, while sitting on the
topmast crosstrees, something uncommonly like the sea
serpent&mdash;but, finding this hint received with incredulous
smiles, he begins to tell them how he hopes that, some
day, he shall be promoted to have charge of the poop.
The passengers hope he will have that honor; they have
no doubt he deserves it. His cheeks flush with pleasure
to hear them say so, and he little thinks that they have
no notion in what "that honor" may happen to consist.</p>

<p>The coach stops: the little midshipman, with his
hands in his pockets, sits rattling his money, and singing.
There is a poor woman standing by the door of
the village inn; she looks careworn, and well she may,
for, in the spring, her husband went up to the city to
seek for work. He got work, and she was expecting
soon to join him there, when alas! a fellow-workman
wrote her word how he had met with an accident, how
he was very ill and wanted his wife to come and nurse
him. But she has two young children, and is destitute;
she must walk up all the way, and she is sick at heart
when she thinks that perhaps he may die among strangers
before she can reach him.</p>

<p>She does not think of begging, but seeing the boy's
eyes attracted to her, she makes him a courtesy, and he
withdraws his hand and throws her down a sovereign.
She looks at it with incredulous joy, and then she looks
at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
    "It's all right," he says, and the coach starts again,
while, full of gratitude, she hires a cart to take her across
the country to the railway, that the next night she may
sit by the bedside of her sick husband.</p>

<p>The midshipman knows nothing about that; and he
never will know.</p>

<p>The passengers go on talking&mdash;the little midshipman
has told them who he is, and where he is going; but
there is one man who has never joined in the conversation;
he is dark-looking and restless; he sits apart; he
has seen the glitter of the falling coin, and now he
watches the boy more narrowly than before.</p>

<p>He is a strong man, resolute and determined; the boy
with the pockets full of money will be no match for him.
The midshipman has told the other passengers that his
father's house is the parsonage at Y&mdash;&mdash;; the coach goes
within five miles of it, and he means to get down at the
nearest point, and walk, or rather run over to his home,
through the great wood.</p>

<p>The man decides to get down too, and go through the
wood; he will rob the little midshipman; perhaps, if he
cries out or struggles, he will do worse. The boy, he
thinks, will have no chance against him; it is quite impossible
that he can escape; the way is lonely, and the
sun will be down.</p>

<p>No. There seems indeed little chance of escape; the
half-fledged bird just fluttering down from its nest has no
more chance against the keen-eyed hawk, than the little
light-hearted sailor boy will have against him&mdash;at least
so thinks the man as he makes his plans.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The coach reaches the village where the boy is to alight.
He wishes the other passengers "good evening," and runs
lightly down between the scattered houses. The man has
got down also, and is following.</p>

<p>The path lies through the village churchyard; there is
evening service, and the door is wide open, for it is warm.
The little midshipman stops by the door, looks in, and
listens. The clergyman has just risen, and is giving out
his text. Thirteen months have past since the boy was
within a house of prayer; and a feeling of pleasure and
awe induces him to stand still and listen.</p>

<p>"Are not two sparrows [he hears] sold for a farthing?
and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your
Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
Fear ye not, therefore, ye are of more value than many
sparrows."</p>

<p>He hears the opening sentences of the sermon; and
then he remembers his home, and comes softly out of the
porch, full of a calm and serious pleasure. The clergyman
has reminded him of his father, and his careless heart
is now filled with the echoes of his voice and of his prayers.
He thinks on what the clergyman said, of the care
of our heavenly Father for us; he remembers how, when
he left home, his father prayed that he might be preserved
through every danger; he does not remember any particular
danger that he has been exposed to, excepting in the
great storm; but he is grateful that he has come home in
safety, and he hopes whenever he shall be in danger, which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
he supposes he shall be some day&mdash;he hopes, that then the
providence of God will watch over him, and protect him.
And so he presses onward to the entrance of the wood.</p>

<p>The man is there before him. He has pushed himself
into the thicket, and cut a heavy club; he suffers the boy
to go on before, and then he comes out and follows him.
It is too light at present for his deed of darkness and
too near the entrance of the wood, but he knows that
shortly the path will branch off into two, and the right
one for the boy to take will be dark and lonely.</p>

<p>But what prompts the little midshipman, when not fifty
yards from the branching of the path, to break into a
sudden run? It is not fear, for he never dreams of danger.
Some sudden impulse, or some wild wish for home,
makes him dash off suddenly, with a whoop and a bound.
On he goes, as if running a race; the path bends, and the
man loses sight of him. "But I shall have him yet," he
thinks; "he can not keep this pace up long."</p>

<p>The boy has nearly reached the place where the path
divides, when he startles a young white owl that can
scarcely fly, and it goes whirring along, close to the
ground, before him. He gains upon it; another moment,
and it will be his. Now it gets the start again; they
come to the branching of the paths, and the bird goes
down the wrong one. The temptation to follow is too
strong to be resisted; he knows that somewhere, deep in
the wood, there is a cross track by which he can get into
the path he has left; if only he runs a little faster, he
shall be at home nearly as soon.</p>

<p>On he rushes; the path takes a bend, and he is just out
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of sight when his pursuer comes where the paths divide.
The boy has turned to the right; the man takes the left,
and the faster they both run the farther they are asunder.</p>

<p>The white owl still leads him on; the path gets darker
and narrower; at last he finds that he has missed it altogether,
and his feet are on the soft ground. He flounders
about among the trees, vexed with himself, and panting
after his race. At last he finds another track, and pushes
on as fast as he can. He has lost his way&mdash;but he keeps
bearing to the left; and, though it is now dark, he thinks
that he must reach the main path sooner or later.</p>

<p>He does not know this part of the wood, but he runs on.
O, little midshipman! why did you chase that owl? If
you had kept in the path with the dark man behind you,
there was a chance that you might have outrun him; or,
if he had overtaken you, some passing wayfarer might
have heard your cries, and come to save you. Now you
are running on straight to your death, for the forest water
is deep and black at the bottom of this hill. O, that the
moon might come out and show it to you!</p>

<p>The moon is under a thick canopy of heavy black clouds;
and there is not a star to glitter on the water and make
it visible. The fern is soft under his feet as he runs and
slips down the sloping hill. At last he strikes his foot
against a stone, stumbles, and falls. Two minutes more
and he will roll into the black water.</p>

<p>"Heyday!" cries the boy, "what's this? Oh, how it
tears my hands! Oh, this thorn bush! Oh, my arms!
I can't get free!" He struggles and pants. "All this
comes of leaving the path," he says; "I shouldn't have
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
cared for rolling down if it hadn't been for this bush.
The fern was soft enough. I'll never stray in a wood
at night again. There, free at last! And my jacket
nearly torn off my back!"</p>

<p>With a good deal of patience, and a great many
scratches, he gets free of the thorn which had arrested
his progress, when his feet were within a yard of the
water, manages to scramble up the bank, and makes
the best of his way through the wood.</p>

<p>And now, as the clouds move slowly onward, the moon
shows her face on the black surface of the water; and
the little white owl comes and hoots, and flutters over
it like a wandering snowdrift. But the boy is deep in
the wood again, and knows nothing of the danger from
which he has escaped.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>III.</h3>

<p>All this time the dark passenger follows the main
track, and believes that his prey is before him. At
last he hears a crashing of dead boughs, and presently
the little midshipman's voice not fifty yards before him.
Yes, it is too true; the boy is in the cross track. He
will pass the cottage in the wood directly, and after that
his pursuer will come upon him.</p>

<p>The boy bounds into the path; but, as he passes the
cottage, he is so thirsty that he thinks he must ask the
people if they will sell him a cup of tea.</p>

<p>He enters without ceremony. "Tea?" says the woodman,
who is sitting at his supper. "No, we have no
tea; but perhaps my wife can give thee a drink of
milk. Come in." So he comes in, and shuts the door;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and, while he sits waiting for the milk, footsteps pass.
They are the footsteps of his pursuer, who goes on
with the club in his hand, and is angry and impatient
that he has not yet come up with him.</p>

<p>The woman goes to her little dairy for the milk, and
the boy thinks she is a long time. He drinks it, thanks
her, and takes his leave.</p>

<p>Fast and fast the man runs on, and, as fast as he can,
the boy runs after him. It is very dark, but there is a
yellow streak in the sky, where the moon is plowing
up a furrowed mass of gray cloud, and one or two
stars are blinking through the branches of the trees.</p>

<p>Fast the boy follows, and fast the man runs on, with
his weapon in his hand. Suddenly he hears the joyish
whoop&mdash;not before, but behind him. He stops and
listens breathlessly. Yes, it is so. He pushes himself
into the thicket, and raises his club to strike when the
boy shall pass.</p>

<p>On he comes, running lightly, with his hands in his
pockets. A sound strikes at the same instant on the
ears of both; and the boy turns back from the very
jaws of death to listen. It is the sound of wheels, and
it draws rapidly nearer. A man comes up, driving a
little gig.</p>

<p>"Halloa?" he says, in a loud, cheerful voice. "What!
benighted, youngster?"</p>

<p>"Oh, is it you, Mr. Davis?" says the boy; "no, I am
not benighted; or, at any rate, I know my way out of
the wood."</p>

<p>The man draws farther back among the shrubs.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
"Why, bless the boy," he hears the farmer say, "to
think of our meeting in this way. The parson told
me he was in hopes of seeing thee some day this week.
I'll give thee a lift. This is a lonely place to be in this
time o' night."</p>

<p>"Lonely!" says the boy, laughing. "I don't mind
that; and if you know the way, it's as safe as the quarter-deck."</p>

<p>So he gets into the farmer's gig, and is once more out
of reach of the pursuer. But the man knows that the
farmer's house is a quarter of a mile nearer than the parsonage,
and in that quarter of a mile there is still a chance
of committing the robbery. He determines still to make
the attempt, and cuts across the wood with such rapid
strides that he reaches the farmer's gate just as the gig
drives up to it.</p>

<p>"Well, thank you, farmer," says the midshipman, as he
prepares to get down.</p>

<p>"I wish you good night, gentlemen," says the man,
when he passes.</p>

<p>"Good night, friend," the farmer replies. "I say, my
boy, it's a dark night enough; but I have a mind to
drive you on to the parsonage, and hear the rest of this
long tale of yours about the sea serpent."</p>

<p>The little wheels go on again. They pass the man;
and he stands still in the road to listen till the sound dies
away. Then he flings his club into the hedge, and goes
back. His evil purposes have all been frustrated&mdash;the
thoughtless boy, without knowing anything about it, has
baffled him at every turn.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>And now the little midshipman is at home&mdash;the joyful
meeting has taken place; and when they have all
admired his growth, and measured his height on the window
frame, and seen him eat his supper, they begin to
question him about his adventures, more for the pleasure
of hearing him talk than any curiosity.</p>

<p>"Adventures!" says the boy, seated between his father
and mother on a sofa. "Why, mother, I wrote you an
account of the voyage, and there's nothing else to tell.
Nothing happened to-day&mdash;at least nothing particular."</p>

<p>"Did you come by the coach we told you of?" asks
his father.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, papa; and when we had got about twenty
miles, there came up a beggar, while we changed horses,
and I threw down, as I thought, a shilling, but, as it fell,
I saw it was a sovereign. She was very honest, and
showed me what it was, but I didn't take it back, for you
know, it's a long time since I gave anything to anybody."</p>

<p>"Very true, my boy," his mother answers; "but you
should not be careless with your money.</p>

<p>"I suppose you got down at the crossroads?" says his
elder brother.</p>

<p>"Yes, and went through the wood. I should have
been here sooner if I hadn't lost my way there."</p>

<p>"Lost your way!" says his mother, alarmed. "My
dear boy, you should not have left the path at dusk."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother," says the little midshipman, with a smile,
"you're always thinking we're in danger. If you could
see me sometimes sitting at the jib-boom end, or across
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the main topmast crosstrees, you <i>would</i> be frightened.
But what danger can there be in a wood?"</p>

<p>"Well, my boy," she answers, "I don't wish to be over-anxious,
and to make my children uncomfortable by my
fears. What did you stray from the path for?"</p>

<p>"Only to chase a little owl, mother; but I didn't
catch her after all. I got a roll down a bank, and caught
my jacket against a thorn bush, which was rather unlucky.
Ah! three large holes I see in my sleeve. And so I
scrambled up again, and got into the path, and stopped at
the cottage for some milk. What a time the woman kept
me, to be sure! But very soon Mr. Davis drove up in
his gig, and he brought me on to the gate."</p>

<p>"And so this story being brought to a close," his father
says, "we find that you had no adventures at all!"</p>

<p>"No, papa, nothing happened; nothing particular, I
mean."</p>

<p>Nothing particular! If they could have known, they
would have thought lightly in comparison of the dangers
of "the jib-boom end, and the main topmast crosstrees."
But they did not know, any more than we do, of the
dangers that hourly beset us. Some few dangers we are
aware of, and we do what we can to provide against
them; but, for the greater portion, "our eyes are held
that we can not see." We walk securely under His
guidance, without whom "not a sparrow falleth to the
ground!" and when we have had escapes that the angels
have wondered at, we come home and say, perhaps, that
"nothing has happened; at least nothing particular."</p>

<h2>THE DEATH OF THE FLOWERS.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wailing winds, and naked woods, and meadows brown and sere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaped in the hollows of the grove, the autumn leaves lie dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rustle to the eddying gust, and to the rabbit's tread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The robin and the wren are flown, and from the shrubs the jay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the wood-top calls the crow through all the gloomy day.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where are the flowers, the fair young flowers, that lately sprang and stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In brighter light and softer airs, a beauteous sisterhood?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! they all are in their graves; the gentle race of flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are lying in their lowly beds, with the fair and good of ours.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rain is falling where they lie, but the cold November rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calls not from out the gloomy earth the lovely ones again.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The windflower and the violet, they perished long ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the brier rose and the orchis died amid the summer glow;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">But on the hill the goldenrod, and the aster in the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the yellow sunflower by the brook in autumn beauty stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till fell the frost from the clear, cold heaven, as falls the plague on men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the brightness of their smile was gone, from upland, glade, and glen.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now, when comes the calm, mild day, as still such days will come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To call the squirrel and the bee from out their winter home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the sound of dropping nuts is heard, though all the trees are still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And twinkle in the smoky light the waters of the rill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The south wind searches for the flowers whose fragrance late he bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sighs to find them in the wood and by the stream no more.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then I think of one who in her youthful beauty died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fair, meek blossom that grew up and faded by my side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the cold, moist earth we laid her, when the forests cast the leaf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we wept that one so lovely should have a life so brief:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet not unmeet it was that one like that young friend of ours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So gentle and so beautiful, should perish with the flowers.<br /></span>

<h2>THE GREAT VOLCANIC ERUPTION.</h2>

<p>In 1883 the most destructive volcanic eruption ever
known occurred in the Straits of Sunda and the neighboring
islands. The trouble began on Sunday morning,
the 13th of May. Java, Sumatra, and Borneo were
convulsed by earthquakes. The surface of the earth
rocked, houses tumbled down, and big trees were shaken
to the ground. Earthquakes are no rarity in those
islands, but this earthquake showed no signs of ceasing.
The earth quivered constantly, and from its depths there
seemed to rise strange sounds and hollow explosions.</p>

<p>On Thursday there came a telegram from Anjer, ninety
miles away, on the northwest coast of Java, intimating
that a volcano had broken out at Krakatoa island, about
thirty miles west of Anjer, in Sunda Strait. I was
requested by the Dutch government to go to the scene
of action and take scientific observations, and by four
o'clock that afternoon I started with a party on board a
special steamer from Batavia.</p>

<p>As we rounded the northern extremity of Java, we saw
ascending from Krakatoa, still fifty miles away, an immense
column of smoke. Its appearance changed as we
approached. First it looked like flame, then it appeared
to be steam, and finally it had the appearance of a pillar
of fire inside one of white fleecy wool. The diameter of
this pillar of fire and smoke was, I should think, at least
one and a half miles. All the while we heard that sullen,
thunderous roar which had been a feature of this disturbance
ever since Sunday, and was now becoming louder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
    We remained on deck all night and watched. The din
increased till we could with difficulty hear one another's
voices. Dawn approached, and when the rays of the sun
fell on the shores of Krakatoa, we saw them reflected from
what we thought was a river, and we resolved to steam
into its mouth and disembark.</p>

<p>When we came to within three quarters of a mile of the
shore, we discovered that what we supposed to be a river
was a torrent of molten sulphur. The smell almost overpowered
us. We steamed away to the windward, and
made for the other side of the island.</p>

<p>This island, though volcanic, had up till now been quiet
for at least a century. It was eight or ten miles long and
four wide, and was covered with forests of fine mahogany
and rosewood trees. It was inhabited by a few fishermen,
but we found no signs of these people. The land, down
to the water's edge, was covered with powdered pumice
stone, which rained down from the clouds around the
great column of fire. Everything with life had already
disappeared from the landscape, which was covered with
a steaming mass of stones and ashes.</p>

<p>Several of us landed and began walking towards the
volcano. We sank deep in the soft pumice, which blistered
our feet with its heat. I climbed painfully upwards
toward the crater, in order to measure it with my sextant;
but in a short time the heat melted the mercury off
the mirror of the instrument. I was then half a mile
from the crater.</p>

<p>As I was returning to the shore, I saw the bottom of
each footstep I had made on my way up glowing red
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
with the heat from beneath. We photographed the scene
from the deck of the steamer, where the fire hose was kept
playing constantly, wetting the rigging and everything
about the ship to prevent her from taking fire.</p>

<p>The steamer then returned to Batavia, and I went to
reside at Anjer. From my villa on the hillside a mile
inland, I could see Krakatoa, thirty miles away, belching
out its never-ending eruption. We supposed that it
would go on till it burned itself out, and that then it
would become quiet again. But in this we were mistaken.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, the 12th of August, nearly
three months later, I was sitting on the veranda of my
house taking my morning cup of tea. I saw the fishing
boats lying at anchor in the bay, the fishermen themselves
being on shore at rest. As my gaze rested on the boats,
I suddenly became aware that they were all beginning to
move rapidly in one direction. Then in an instant, to
my intense surprise, they all disappeared.</p>

<p>I ran farther up the hillside to get a better view, and
looked far out to sea. Instantly a great glare of fire
right in the midst of the sea caught my eye. All the
way across the bay and the strait, in a line of flame
reaching to Krakatoa itself, the bottom of the sea seemed
to have cracked open so that the subterraneous fires were
belching forth. On either side the waters were pouring
into this gulf with a tremendous noise, but the fire was
not extinguished.</p>

<p>The hissing roar brought out the people of Anjer in
excited crowds. My eyes were turned away for a moment
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
as I beckoned to some one, and during that moment
came a terrible, deafening explosion. It stunned me;
and when I was able again to turn my eyes toward the
bay, I could see nothing. The whole scene was shrouded
in darkness, from amid which came cries and groans, the
creaking of breaking beams in the houses, and, above all,
the roar of the breakers on the shore. The city of Anjer,
with its sixty thousand people, had been engulfed!</p>

<p>I afterwards found that the water was one hundred feet
deep where the city of Anjer had been, and that the coast
line had moved one and a half miles inland. A big island
in the strait had been split in two, with a wide passage
between its parts. An island to the northwest of Krakatoa
had wholly disappeared. The air was filled with
minute particles of dust, which after some weeks spread
even to Europe and America. What the causes of such
a tremendous convulsion may have been, it is quite impossible
accurately to say.</p>

<p>The foregoing narrative was written by J. T. Van Gestel,
who was at the time residing in the island of Java.

eruption of Vesuvius and the destruction of Pompeii,

<h2>THE RETURN OF COLUMBUS.</h2>

<p>The fame of the discovery made by Columbus had
resounded throughout the nation, and, as his route lay
through several of the finest and most populous provinces
of Spain, his journey appeared like the progress
of a sovereign. Wherever he passed, the country poured
forth its inhabitants, who lined the road and thronged
the villages. The streets, windows, and balconies of
the towns were filled with eager spectators, who rent
the air with acclamations. His journey was continually
impeded by the multitude pressing to gain a sight
of him and of the Indians, who were regarded with
as much astonishment as if they had been natives of
another planet. It was impossible to satisfy the craving
curiosity which assailed himself and his attendants
at every stage with innumerable questions; popular
rumor, as usual, had exaggerated the truth, and had
filled the newly found country with all kinds of wonders.</p>

<p>About the middle of April Columbus arrived at Barcelona,
where every preparation had been made to give
him a solemn and magnificent reception. The beauty and
serenity of the weather in that genial season and favored
climate contributed to give splendor to this memorable
ceremony. As he drew near the place, many of the more
youthful courtiers and hidalgos, together with a vast concourse
of the populace, came forth to meet and welcome
him. His entrance into this noble city has been compared
to one of those triumphs which the Romans were accustomed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
to decree to conquerors. First were paraded the
Indians, painted according to their savage fashion, and
decorated with their national ornaments of gold; after
these were borne various kinds of live parrots, together
with stuffed birds and animals of unknown species, and
rare plants supposed to be of precious qualities; while
great care was taken to make a conspicuous display of
Indian coronets, bracelets, and other decorations of gold,
which might give an idea of the wealth of the newly discovered
regions. After this followed Columbus on horseback,
surrounded by a brilliant cavalcade of Spanish
chivalry. The streets were almost impassable from the
countless multitude; the windows and balconies were
crowded with the fair; the very roofs were covered with
spectators. It seemed as if the public eye could not be
sated with gazing on these trophies of an unknown world,
or on the remarkable man by whom it had been discovered.
There was a sublimity in this event that mingled
a solemn feeling with the public joy. It was looked upon
as a vast and signal dispensation of Providence in reward
for the piety of the monarchs; and the majestic and
venerable appearance of the discoverer, so different from
the youth and buoyancy generally expected from roving
enterprise, seemed in harmony with the grandeur and
dignity of his achievement.</p>

<p>To receive him with suitable pomp and distinction,
the sovereigns had ordered their throne to be placed in
public, under a rich canopy of brocade of gold, in a vast
and splendid saloon. Here the king and queen awaited
his arrival, seated in state, with the Prince Juan beside
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
them, and attended by the dignitaries of their court, and
the principal nobility of Castile, Valencia, Catalonia, and
Aragon, all impatient to behold the man who had conferred
so incalculable a benefit upon the nation. At
length Columbus entered the hall, surrounded by a brilliant
crowd of cavaliers, among whom, says Las Casas, he
was conspicuous for his stately and commanding person,
which, with his countenance rendered venerable by his
gray hairs, gave him the august appearance of a senator
of Rome. A modest smile lighted up his features, showing
that he enjoyed the state and glory in which he came;
and certainly nothing could be more deeply moving to a
mind inflamed by noble ambition, and conscious of having
greatly deserved, than these testimonials of the admiration
and gratitude of a nation, or rather of a world. As
Columbus approached, the sovereigns rose, as if receiving
a person of the highest rank. Bending his knees, he
offered to kiss their hands; but there was some hesitation
on their part to permit this act of homage. Raising him
in the most gracious manner, they ordered him to seat
himself in their presence; a rare honor in this proud and
punctilious court.</p>

<p>At their request, he now gave an account of the most
striking events of his voyage, and a description of the
islands discovered. He displayed specimens of unknown
birds and other animals; of rare plants of medicinal and
aromatic virtues; of native gold in dust, in crude masses,
or labored into barbaric ornaments; and, above all, the
natives of these countries, who were objects of intense
and inexhaustible interest. All these he pronounced mere
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
harbingers of greater discoveries yet to be made, which
would add realms of incalculable wealth to the dominions
of their majesties, and whole nations of proselytes to the
true faith.</p>

<p>When he had finished, the sovereigns sank on their
knees, and, raising their clasped hands to heaven, their
eyes filled with tears of joy and gratitude, poured forth
thanks and praises to God for so great a providence; all
present followed their example; a deep and solemn enthusiasm
pervaded that splendid assembly, and prevented
all common acclamations of triumph. The anthem <i>Te
Deum laudamus</i>, chanted by the choir of the royal chapel,
with the accompaniment of instruments, rose in full body
of sacred harmony, bearing up as it were the feelings and
thoughts of the auditors to heaven, "so that" says the
venerable Las Casas, "it seemed as if in that hour they
communicated with celestial delights." Such was the
solemn and pious manner in which the brilliant court of
Spain celebrated this sublime event; offering up a grateful
tribute of melody and praise, and giving glory to God
for the discovery of another world.</p>

<p class="cen">*****</p>

<p>This description of the reception of the great discoverer
after his return from his first voyage, is from Washington
Irving's famous book entitled "The Life and Voyages of
Columbus." Other readings on the same subject are to be
found in Prescott's "Ferdinand and Isabella," Kingston's
"Notable Voyagers," Mrs. Bolton's "Famous Voyagers,"

<h2>WHAT THE SUNBEAMS DO.</h2>

<p>What work do the sunbeams do for us? They do two
things,&mdash;they give us light and heat. It is by means of
them alone that we see anything.</p>

<p>When the room was dark you could not distinguish the
table, the chairs, or even the walls of the room. Why?
Because they had no light waves to send to your eye.
But as the sunbeams began to pour in at the window, the
waves played upon the things in the room; and when
they hit them they bounded off them back to your eye,
as a wave of the sea bounds back from a rock, and strikes
against a passing boat. Then, when they fell upon your
eye, they entered it, and excited the retina and the
nerves; and the image of the chair or the table was
carried to your brain.</p>

<p>Some substances send back hardly any waves of light,
but let them all pass through them. A pane of clear
glass, for instance, lets nearly all the light waves pass
through it; and therefore you often can not see the glass,
because no light messengers come back to you from it.
Thus people have sometimes walked up against a glass
door, and broken it, not seeing it was there.</p>

<p>Those substances are transparent, which, for some reason
unknown to us, allow the ether waves to pass through
them. In clear glass, all the light waves pass through;
while in a white wall the larger part of the rays are
reflected back to the eye. Into polished shining metal
the waves hardly enter at all, but are thrown back from
the surface; and so a steel knife or a silver spoon is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
very bright, and is clearly seen. Quicksilver is put
at the back of looking-glasses because it reflects so many
waves.</p>

<p>The reflected light waves not only make us see things,
but they make us see them in different colors. Imagine
a sunbeam playing on a leaf: part of its waves bound
straight back from it to our eye, and make us see the
surface of the leaf; but the rest go right into the leaf
itself, and there some of them are used up and kept
prisoners. The red, orange, yellow, blue, indigo, and
violet waves are all useful to the leaf, and it does not let
them go again. But it can not absorb the green waves,
and so it throws them back; and they travel to your eye,
and make you see a green color. So, when you say a leaf
is green, you mean that the leaf does not want the green
waves of the sunbeam, but sends them back to you. In
the same way the scarlet geranium rejects the red waves;
a white tablecloth sends back nearly the whole of the
waves, and a black coat scarcely any.</p>

<p>Is it not strange that there is really no such thing as
color in the leaf, the table, the coat, or the geranium;
that we see them of different colors because they send
back only certain-colored waves to our eye?</p>

<p>So far we have spoken only of light; but hold your
hand in the sun, and feel the heat of the sunbeams, and
then consider if the waves of heat do not do work also.
There are many waves in a sunbeam which move too
slowly to make us see light when they hit our eye; but
we can feel them as heat, though we cannot see them as
light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
    The simplest way of feeling heat waves is to hold a
warm flatiron near your face. You know that no light
comes from it, yet you can feel the heat waves beating
violently against your face.</p>

<p>Now, there are many of these dark heat rays in a sunbeam,
and it is they that do most of the work in the
world. It is the heat waves that make the air hot and
light, and so cause it to rise, and make winds and air
currents; and these again give rise to ocean currents.
It is these dark rays, again, that strike upon the land,
and give it the warmth which enables plants to grow. It
is they also that keep up the warmth in our own bodies,
both by coming to us directly from the sun, and also in a
very roundabout way through plants.</p>

<p>Coal is made of plants, and the heat it gives out is the
heat these plants once took in. Think how much work
is done by burning coal. Not only are our houses warmed
by coal fires and lighted by coal gas, but our steam
engines work entirely by water which has been turned
into steam by the heat of coal fires; and our steamboats
travel all over the world by means of the same power.</p>

<p>In the same way the oil of our lamps comes either from
olives, which grow on trees, or from coal and the remains
of plants in the earth. Even our tallow candles are made
of mutton fat, and sheep eat grass; and so, turn which
way we will, we find that the light and heat on our earth,
whether it comes from fires, or candles, or lamps, or gas,
is equally the work of those waves of ether coming from
the sun, which make what we call a sunbeam.</p>

</div>
<p>Tarquin the Proud was the seventh and last king of
Rome. Such were his acts of tyranny, and such the
crimes of his son, "the false Sextus," that the people
rose in rebellion, and, in the year 509 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, drove him
and his family away from Rome and declared
that they would have no more
kings. The Tarquins took refuge
among the Etruscans, whose country
bordered Rome on the north. They
made a treaty of friendship with
Porsena, the king of Clusium,
and induced him to raise a
large army for the purpose of
forcing the Romans to allow
them to return to power. A
battle was fought, and the Romans
being defeated were obliged
to flee across the wooden bridge which spanned the Tiber
at Rome. To prevent Porsena from entering the city, the
Roman Consul ordered that the bridge should be destroyed.</p>

<p>The story of the manner in which this was done is told
by Lord Macaulay in his "Lays of Ancient Rome," a collection
of heroic ballads relating to the times of the kings
and the early consuls. The author speaks, not in his own
person, but in the person of an ancient minstrel who is
supposed to have lived about one hundred years after the
event, and who therefore knew only what a Roman citizen
of that time could have known.</p>

<h2>HOW SIR FRANCIS DRAKE SAILED ROUND<br />
THE WORLD.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">

 <p class="caption2">Sir Francis Drake.</p>
</div>
<p>The ships which the Spaniards used on the Pacific
were usually built on the spot. But Magellan was
known to have gone by the Horn, and where a Portuguese
could go an Englishman could go.
Drake proposed to try. The vessels in
which he was preparing to tempt fortune
seem preposterously small. The
"Pelican," or "Golden Hind,"
which belonged to Drake himself,
was but 120 tons, at best
no larger than a modern racing
yawl, though perhaps no
racing yawl was ever better
equipped for the work which
she had to do. The next,
the "Elizabeth" of London,
was said to be eighty tons; a small pinnace of twelve
tons, in which we should hardly risk a summer cruise
round the Land's End, with two sloops or frigates of fifty
and thirty tons, made the rest. The "Elizabeth" was
commanded by Captain Winter, a queen's officer, and
perhaps a son of the old admiral.</p>

<p>We may credit Drake with knowing what he was
about. He and his comrades were carrying their lives
in their hands. If they were taken they would be inevitably
hanged. Their safety depended on speed of
sailing, and specially on the power of working fast to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
windward, which the heavy square-rigged ships could
not do. The crews all told were one hundred and sixty
men and boys.</p>

<p>On November 15th, 1577, the "Pelican" and her consorts
sailed out of Plymouth Sound. The elements frowned
on their start. On the second day they were caught in
a winter gale. The "Pelican" sprung her mainmast,
and they put back to refit and repair. Before the middle
of December all was again in order. The weather
mended, and with a fair wind and smooth water they
made a fast run down the coast to the Cape de Verde
Islands. There taking up the northeast Trades, they
struck across the Atlantic. They passed the mouth of
the Plate River, finding to their astonishment fresh water
at the ship's side in fifty-four fathoms. On June 20th
they reached Port St. Julian on the coast of Patagonia.</p>

<p>It was now midwinter, the stormiest season of the
year, and they remained for six weeks in Port St. Julian.
They burnt the twelve-ton pinnace, as too small for the
work they had now before them, and there remained only
the "Pelican," the "Elizabeth," and the "Marigold." In
cold, wild weather they weighed at last, and on August
20th made the opening of Magellan's Straits. The passage
is seventy miles long, tortuous and dangerous.
They had no charts. Icy mountains overhung them on
either side; heavy snow fell below. They brought up
occasionally at an island to rest the men, and let them
kill a few seals and penguins to give them fresh food.
Everything they saw was new, wild, and wonderful.</p>

<p>Having to feel their way, they were three weeks in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
getting through. They had counted on reaching the
Pacific that the worst of their work was over, and that
they could run north at once into warmer and calmer
latitudes. The peaceful ocean, when they entered it,
proved the stormiest they had ever sailed on. A fierce
westerly gale drove them six hundred miles to the southeast
outside the Horn. The "Marigold" went down in the
tremendous encounter. Captain Winter in the "Elizabeth"
made his way back into Magellan's Straits. There
he lay for three weeks, lighting fires nightly to show
Drake where he was; but no Drake appeared. They had
agreed, if separated, to meet on the coast in the latitude
of Valparaiso; but Winter was chicken-hearted, and sore,
we are told, "against the mariners' will," when the three
weeks were out, he sailed away for England, where he
reported that all the ships were lost but the "Pelican,"
and that the "Pelican" was probably lost too.</p>

<p>Drake had believed better of Winter, and had not
expected to be so deserted. He had himself taken refuge
among the islands which form the Cape, waiting for the
spring and milder weather. He used the time in making
surveys, and observing the habits of the native Patagonians.
The days lengthened, and the sea smoothed at last.
He then sailed for Valparaiso, hoping to meet Winter
there, as he had arranged. At Valparaiso there was no
Winter, but there was in the port instead a great galleon
just come in from Peru. The galleon's crew took him
for a Spaniard, hoisted their colors, and beat their drums.
The "Pelican" shot alongside. The English sailors
in high spirits leaped on board. No life was taken;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Drake never hurt man if he could help it. The crew
jumped overboard, and swam ashore. The prize was
examined. Four hundred pounds' weight of gold was
found in her, besides other plunder.</p>

<p>Drake went on next to Tarapaca, where silver from the
Andes mines was shipped for Panama. At Tarapaca
there was the same unconsciousness of danger. The
silver bars lay piled on the quay, the muleteers who had
brought them were sleeping peacefully in the sunshine at
their side. The muleteers were left to their slumbers.
The bars were lifted into the English boats. A train of
mules or llamas came in at that moment with a second
load as rich as the first. This, too, went into the "Pelican's"
hold. The bullion taken at Tarapaca was worth
nearly half a million ducats.</p>

<p>Still there was no news of Winter. Drake began to
realize that he was now entirely alone, and had only himself
and his own crew to depend on. There was nothing
to do but to go through with it, danger adding to the
interest. Arica was the next point visited. Half a
hundred blocks of silver were picked up at Arica. After
Arica came Lima, the chief depot of all, where the grandest
haul was looked for. At Lima, alas! they were just
too late. Twelve great hulks lay anchored there. The
sails were unbent, the men were ashore. They contained
nothing but some chests of reels and a few bales of silk
and linen. But a thirteenth, called the "Cacafuego," had
sailed a few days before for the Isthmus with the whole
produce of the Lima mines for the season. Her ballast
was silver, her cargo gold and emeralds and rubies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
    Drake deliberately cut the cables of the ships in the
roads, that they might drive ashore and be unable to
follow him. The "Pelican" spread her wings, and sped
away in pursuit. He would know the "Cacafuego," so
he learned at Lima, by the peculiar cut of her sails. The
first man who caught sight of her was promised a gold
chain for his reward. A sail was seen on the second
day. It was not the chase, but it was worth stopping
for. Eighty pounds' weight of gold was found, and a
great gold crucifix, set with emeralds said to be as large
as pigeons' eggs.</p>

<p>We learn from the Spanish accounts that the Viceroy
of Lima, as soon as he recovered from his astonishment,
dispatched ships in pursuit. They came up with the
last plundered vessel, heard terrible tales of the rovers'
strength, and went back for a larger force. The "Pelican"
meanwhile went along upon her course for eight hundred
miles. At length, off Quito, and close under the shore,
the "Cacafuego's" peculiar sails were sighted, and the gold
chain was claimed. There she was, going lazily along a
few miles ahead. Care was needed in approaching her.
If she guessed the "Pelican's" character she would run
in upon the land, and they would lose her. It was
afternoon. The sun was still above the horizon, and
Drake meant to wait till night, when the breeze would be
off the shore, as in the tropics it always is.</p>

<p>The "Pelican" sailed two feet to the "Cacafuego's" one.
Drake filled his empty wine skins with water and trailed
them astern to stop his way. The chase supposed that
she was followed by some heavily-loaded trader, and,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
wishing for company on a lonely voyage, she slackened
sail, and waited for him to come up. At length the sun
went down into the ocean, the rosy light faded from off
the snows of the Andes; and when both ships had become
invisible from the shore, the skins were hauled in,
the night wind rose, and the water began to ripple under
the "Pelican's" bows. The "Cacafuego" was swiftly overtaken,
and when within a cable's length a voice hailed her
to put her head into the wind. The Spanish commander,
not understanding so strange an order, held on his course.
A broadside brought down his mainyard, and a flight of
arrows rattled on his deck. He was himself wounded.
In a few minutes he was a prisoner, and the ship and her
precious freight were in the corsair's power. The wreck
was cut away; the ship was cleared; a prize crew was
put on board. Both vessels turned their heads to the
sea. At daybreak no land was to be seen, and the examination
of the prize began. The full value was never
acknowledged. The invoice, if there was one, was destroyed.
The accurate figures were known only to Drake
and Queen Elizabeth. A published schedule acknowledged
to twenty tons of silver bullion, thirteen chests of
silver coins, and a hundredweight of gold, but there were
gold nuggets beside in indefinite quantity, and "a great
store" of pearls, emeralds, and diamonds.</p>

<p>Drake, we are told, was greatly satisfied. He thought
it prudent to stay in the neighborhood no longer than
necessary. He went north with all sail set, taking his
prize along with him. The master, San Juan de Anton, was
removed on board the "Pelican," to have his wound attended
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
to. He remained as Drake's guest for a week,
and sent in a report of what he observed to the Spanish
government. One at least of Drake's party spoke excellent
Spanish. This person took San Juan over the ship.
She showed signs, San Juan said, of rough service, but
was still in fine condition, with ample arms, spare rope,
mattocks, carpenters' tools of all descriptions. There
were eighty-five men on board all told, fifty of them men
of war, the rest young fellows, ship boys, and the like.
Drake himself was treated with great reverence; a sentinel
stood always at his cabin door. He dined alone with
music.</p>

</div>
<p>The "Pelican" met with many other adventures, and at
last sailed for home. Sweeping in fine
clear weather round the Cape of Good
Hope, she touched once for water
at Sierra Leone, and finally sailed
in triumph into Plymouth
Harbor.</p>

<p>English sympathy with an
extraordinary exploit is always
irresistible. Shouts of
applause rang through the
country; and Elizabeth, every
bit of her an English-woman,
felt with her subjects. She
sent for Drake to London, made him tell his story over
and over again, and was never weary of listening to him.</p>

<h2>A BRAVE RESCUE AND A ROUGH RIDE.</h2>

<p>It happened upon a November evening (when I was
about fifteen years old, and outgrowing my strength very
rapidly, my sister Annie being turned thirteen, and a deal
of rain having fallen, and all the troughs in the yard
being flooded, and the bark from the wood ricks washed
down the gutter, and even our watershoot growing
brown) that the ducks in the barnyard made a terrible
quacking, instead of marching off to their pen, one behind
another. Thereupon Annie and I ran out to see what
might be the sense of it. There were thirteen ducks, and
ten lily-white (as the fashion of ducks then was), not, I
mean, twenty-three in all, but ten white and three brown-striped
ones; and without being nice about their color,
they all quacked very movingly. They pushed their
gold-colored bills here and there (yet dirty, as gold is apt
to be), and they jumped on the triangles of their feet,
and sounded out of their nostrils; and some of the overexcited
ones ran along low on the ground, quacking
grievously, with their bills snapping and bending, and the
roof of their mouths exhibited.</p>

<p>Annie began to cry "dilly, dilly, einy, einy, ducksey,"
according to the burden of a tune they seem to have accepted
as the national ducks' anthem; but instead of being
soothed by it, they only quacked three times as hard, and
ran round till we were giddy. And then they shook their
tails all together, and looked grave, and went round and
round again.</p>

<p>Now, I am uncommonly fond of ducks, whether roystering,

roosting, or roasted; and it is a fine sight to behold
them walk, paddling one after another, with their toes
out, like soldiers drilling, and their little eyes cocked all
ways at once, and the way that they dib with their bills,
and dabble, and throw up their heads and enjoy something,
and then tell the others about it. Therefore, I
knew at once, by the way they were carrying on, that
there must be something or other gone wholly amiss in
the duck world. Sister Annie perceived it, too, but with
a greater quickness; for she counted them like a good
duck wife, and could only tell thirteen of them, when she
knew there ought to be fourteen.</p>

<p>And so we began to search about, and the ducks ran to
lead us aright, having come that far to fetch us; and
when we got down to the foot of the courtyard where
the two great ash trees stand by the side of the little
water, we found good reason for the urgence and melancholy
of the duck birds. Lo! the old white drake, the
father of all, a bird of high manners and chivalry, always
the last to help himself from the pan of barley meal, and
the first to show fight to a dog or cock intruding upon his
family, this fine fellow, and a pillar of the state, was now
in a sad predicament, yet quacking very stoutly.</p>

<p>For the brook, wherewith he had been familiar from his
callow childhood, and wherein he was wont to quest for
water newts, and tadpoles, and caddice worms, and other
game, this brook, which afforded him very often scanty
space to dabble in, and sometimes starved the cresses, was
now coming down in a great brown flood, as if the banks
never belonged to it. The foaming of it, and the noise,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
and the cresting of the corners, and the up and down, like
the wave of the sea, were enough to frighten any duck,
though bred upon stormy waters, which our ducks never
had been.</p>

<p>There is always a hurdle six feet long and four and a
half in depth, swung by a chain at either end from an oak
laid across the channel. And the use of this hurdle is to
keep our kine at milking time from straying away there
drinking (for in truth they are very dainty) and to fence
strange cattle, or Farmer Snowe's horses, from coming
along the bed of the brook unknown, to steal our substance.</p>

<p>But now this hurdle, which hung in the summer a foot
above the trickle, would have been dipped more than two
feet deep but for the power against it. For the torrent
came down so vehemently that the chains in full stretch
were creaking, and the hurdle buffeted almost flat, and
thatched (so to say), with the drift stuff, was going seesaw
with a sulky splash on the dirty red comb of the
waters.</p>

<p>But saddest to see was between two bars, where a fog was
of rushes, and flood wood, and wild celery, and dead crow's-foot.
For there was our venerable mallard jammed in by
the joint of his shoulder, speaking aloud as he rose and
fell, with his topknot full of water, unable to comprehend
it, with his tail washed far away from him, but often compelled
to be silent, being ducked very harshly against his
will by the choking fall to of the hurdle.</p>

<p>For a moment I could not help laughing; because, being
borne high up and dry by a tumult of the torrent, he gave
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
me a look from his one little eye (having lost one in fight
with a turkey cock), a gaze of appealing sorrow, and then
a loud quack to second it. But the quack came out of
time, I suppose, for his throat got filled with water, as
the hurdle carried him back again. And then there was
scarcely the screw of his tail to be seen until he swung
up again, and left small doubt, by the way he spluttered,
and failed to quack, and hung down his poor crest, but
what he must drown in another minute, and frogs triumph
over his body.</p>

<p>Annie was crying and wringing her hands, and I was
about to rush into the water, although I liked not the look
of it, but hoped to hold on by the hurdle, when a man on
horseback came suddenly round the corner of the great
ash hedge on the other side of the stream, and his horse's
feet were in the water.</p>

<p>"Ho, there," he cried, "get thee back, boy! The flood
will carry thee down like a straw. I will do it for thee,
and no trouble."</p>

<p>With that he leaned forward, and spoke to his mare&mdash;she
was just of the tint of a strawberry, a young thing,
very beautiful&mdash;and she arched up her neck, as misliking
the job; yet, trusting him, would attempt it. She
entered the flood, with her dainty fore legs sloped further
and further in front of her, and her delicate ears pricked
forward, and the size of her great eyes increasing; but he
kept her straight in the turbid rush, by the pressure of his
knee on her.</p>

<p>Then she looked back, and wondered at him, as the force
of the torrent grew stronger, but he bade her go on; and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
on she went, and it foamed up over her shoulders; and
she tossed up her lip and scorned it, for now her courage
was waking.</p>

<p>Then, as the rush of it swept her away, and she struck
with her forefeet down the stream, he leaned from his
saddle in a manner which I never could have thought
possible, and caught up old Tom with his left hand, and
set him between his hostlers, and smiled at his faint quack
of gratitude. In a moment all three were carried down
stream, and the rider lay flat on his horse, and tossed the
hurdle clear from him, and made for the bend of smooth
water.</p>

<p>They landed some thirty or forty yards lower, in the
midst of our kitchen garden, where the winter cabbage
was; but though Annie and I crept in through the hedge,
and were full of our thanks and admiring him, he would
answer us never a word until he had spoken in full to the
mare, as if explaining the whole to her.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart, I know thou couldst have leaped it," he
said, as he patted her cheek, being on the ground by this
time, and she was nudging up to him, with the water
pattering off from her; "but I had good reason, Winnie
dear, for making thee go through it."</p>

<p>She answered him kindly with her soft eyes, and sniffed
at him very lovingly, and they understood one another.
Then he took from his waistcoat two peppercorns, and
made the old drake swallow them, and tried him softly on
his legs, where the leading gap in the hedge was.</p>

<p>Old Tom stood up quite bravely, and clapped his wings,
and shook off the wet from his tail feathers; and then away
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
into the courtyard, and his family gathered around him,
and they all made a noise in their throats, and stood up,
and put their bills together, to thank God for his great
deliverance.</p>

<p>Having taken all this trouble, and watched the end of
that adventure, the gentleman turned round to us with a
pleasant smile on his face, as if he were lightly amused
with himself; and we came up and looked at him. He was
rather short, about John Fry's height, or maybe a little
taller, but very strongly built and springy, as his gait at
every step showed plainly, although his legs were bowed
with much riding, and he looked as if he lived on horseback.</p>

<p>To a boy like me he seemed very old, being over
twenty, and well found in beard; but he was not more
than four and twenty, fresh and ruddy looking, with a
short nose and keen blue eyes, and a merry, waggish jerk
about him, as if the world were not in earnest. Yet he
had a sharp, stern way, like the crack of a pistol, if anything
misliked him; and we knew (for children see such
things) that it was safer to tickle than buffet him.</p>

<p>"Well, young ones, what be gaping at?" He gave
pretty Annie a chuck on the chin, and took me all in
without winking.</p>

<p>"Your mare," said I, standing stoutly up, being a tall
boy now; "I never saw such a beauty, sir. Will you let
me have a ride on her?"</p>

<p>"Think thou couldst ride her, lad? She will have no
burden but mine. Thou couldst never ride her! Tut!
I would be loath to kill thee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
    "Ride her!" I cried, with the bravest scorn, for she
looked so kind and gentle; "there never was horse upon
Exmoor but I could tackle in half an hour. Only I
never ride upon saddle. Take those leathers off of her."</p>

<p>He looked at me with a dry little whistle, and thrust
his hands into his pockets, and so grinned that I could not
stand it. And Annie laid hold of me in such a way that
I was almost mad with her. And he laughed, and approved
her for doing so. And the worst of all was&mdash;he said
nothing.</p>

<p>"Get away, Annie. Do you think I'm a fool, good sir?
Only trust me with her, and I will not override her."</p>

<p>"For that I will go bail, my son. She is liker to override
thee. But the ground is soft to fall upon, after all
this rain. Now come out into the yard, young man, for
the sake of your mother's cabbages. And the mellow
straw bed will be softer for thee, since pride must have
its fall. I am thy mother's cousin, boy, and I'm going
up to the house. Tom Faggus is my name, as everybody
knows, and this is my young mare, Winnie."</p>

<p>What a fool I must have been not to know it at once!
Tom Faggus, the great highwayman, and his young
blood mare, the strawberry. Already her fame was
noised abroad, nearly as much as her master's, and my
longing to ride her grew tenfold, but fear came at the
back of it. Not that I had the smallest fear of what the
mare could do to me, by fair play and horse trickery, but
that the glory of sitting upon her seemed to be too great
for me; especially as there were rumors abroad that she
was not a mare, after all, but a witch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
    However, she looked like a filly all over, and wonderfully
beautiful with her supple stride, and soft slope of
shoulder, and glossy coat beaded with water, and prominent
eyes full of docile fire. Whether this came from
her Eastern blood of the Arabs newly imported, and
whether the cream color, mixed with our bay, led to
that bright strawberry tint, is certainly more than I
can decide, being chiefly acquaint with farm horses.
And these are of any color and form; you never can
count what they will be, and are lucky to get four legs
to them.</p>

<p>Mr. Faggus gave his mare a wink, and she walked
demurely after him, a bright young thing, flowing over
with life, yet dropping her soul to a higher one, and led
by love to anything, as the manner is of such creatures,
when they know what is the best for them. Then Winnie
trod lightly upon the straw, because it had soft muck
under it, and her delicate feet came back again.</p>

<p>"Up for it still, boy, be ye?" Tom Faggus stopped,
and the mare stopped there; and they looked at me
provokingly.</p>

<p>"Is she able to leap, sir? There is good take-off on
this side of the brook."</p>

<p>Mr. Faggus laughed very quietly, turning round to
Winnie so that she might enter into it. And she, for her
part, seemed to know exactly where the fun lay.</p>

<p>"Good tumble off, you mean, my boy. Well, there
can be small harm to thee. I am akin to thy family, and
know the substance of their skulls."</p>

<p>"Let me get up," said I, waxing wroth, for reasons I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
can not tell you, because they are too manifold; "take off
your saddlebag things. I will try not to squeeze her
ribs in, unless she plays nonsense with me."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Faggus was up on his mettle at this proud
speech of mine, and John Fry was running up all the
while, and Bill Dadds, and half a dozen others. Tom
Faggus gave one glance around, and then dropped all
regard for me. The high repute of his mare was at stake,
and what was my life compared to it? Through my
defiance, and stupid ways, here was I in a duello, and
my legs not come to their strength yet, and my arms
as limp as herring.</p>

<p>Something of this occurred to him, even in his wrath
with me, for he spoke very softly to the filly, who now
could scarce subdue herself; but she drew in her nostrils,
and breathed to his breath, and did all she could
to answer him.</p>

<p>"Not too hard, my dear," he said; "let him gently
down on the mixen. That will be quite enough." Then
he turned the saddle off, and I was up in a moment.
She began at first so easily, and pricked her ears so lovingly,
and minced about as if pleased to find so light a
weight upon her, that I thought she knew I could ride
a little, and feared to show any capers. "Gee wugg,
Polly!" cried I, for all the men were now looking on,
being then at the leaving-off time; "gee wugg, Polly,
and show what thou be'est made of." With that I
plugged my heels into her, and Billy Dadds flung his
hat up.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she outraged not, though her eyes were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
frightening Annie, and John Fry took a pick to keep
him safe; but she curbed to and fro with her strong forearms
rising like springs ingathered, waiting and quivering
grievously, and beginning to sweat about it. Then
her master gave a shrill, clear whistle, when her ears
were bent toward him, and I felt her form beneath me
gathering up like whalebone, and her hind legs coming
under her, and I knew that I was in for it.</p>

<p>First she reared upright in the air, and struck me full
on the nose with her comb, till I bled worse than Robin
Snell made me; and then down with her fore feet deep
in the straw, and with her hind feet going to heaven.
Finding me stick to her still like wax, for my mettle was
up as hers was, away she flew with me swifter than ever
I went before, or since, I trow.</p>

<p>She drove full head at the cob wall&mdash;"Oh, Jack, slip
off!" screamed Annie&mdash;then she turned like light, when
I thought to crush her, and ground my left knee against
it. "Dear me!" I cried, for my breeches were broken,
and short words went the farthest&mdash;"if you kill me, you
shall die with me." Then she took the courtyard gate
at a leap, knocking my words between my teeth, and
then right over a quickset hedge, as if the sky were a
breath to her; and away for the water meadows, while I
lay on her neck like a child and wished I had never been
born.</p>

<p>Straight away, all in the front of the wind, and scattering
clouds around her, all I know of the speed we made
was the frightful flash of her shoulders, and her mane
like trees in a tempest. I felt the earth under us rushing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
away, and the air left far behind us, and my breath
came and went, and I prayed to God, and was sorry to
be so late of it.</p>

<p>All the long swift while, without power of thought, I
clung to her crest and shoulders, and was proud of holding
on so long, though sure of being beaten. Then in
her fury at feeling me still, she rushed at another device
for it, and leaped the wide water-trough sideways across,
to and fro, till no breath was left in me. The hazel
boughs took me too hard in the face, and the tall dog-briers
got hold of me, and the ache of my back was like
crimping a fish, till I longed to give it up, thoroughly
beaten, and lie there and die in the cresses.</p>

<p>But there came a shrill whistle from up the home hill,
where the people had hurried to watch us, and the mare
stopped as if with a bullet, then set off for home with
the speed of a swallow, and going as smoothly and silently.
I never had dreamed of such delicate motion,
fluent, and graceful, and ambient, soft as the breeze flitting
over the flowers, but swift as the summer lightning.</p>

<p>I sat up again, but my strength was all spent, and no
time left to recover it; and though she rose at our gate
like a bird, I tumbled off into the soft mud.</p>

<p>"Well done, lad," Mr. Faggus said, good-naturedly;
for all were now gathered round me, as I rose from the
ground, somewhat tottering, and miry, and crest-fallen,
but otherwise none the worse (having fallen upon my
head, which is of uncommon substance); "not at all bad
work, my boy; we may teach you to ride by and by, I
see; I thought not to see you stick on so long&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
    "I should have stuck on much longer, sir, if her sides
had not been wet. She was so slippery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Boy, thou art right. She hath given many the slip.
Ha! ha! Vex not, Jack, that I laugh at thee. She is
like a sweetheart to me, and better than any of them be.
It would have gone to my heart if thou hadst conquered.
None but I can ride my Winnie mare."</p>

<p>"Foul shame to thee, then, Tom Faggus," cried mother,
coming up suddenly, and speaking so that all were amazed,
having never seen her wrathful, "to put my boy, my boy,
across her, as if his life were no more than thine! A
man would have taken thy mad horse and thee, and flung
them both into a horse pond&mdash;ay, and what's more, I'll
have it done now, if a hair of his head is injured. Oh,
my boy, my boy! Put up the other arm, Johnny." All
the time mother was scolding so, she was feeling me and
wiping me; while Faggus tried to look greatly ashamed,
having sense of the ways of women.</p>

<p>"Only look at his jacket, mother!" cried Annie; "and
a shilling's worth gone from his smallclothes!"</p>

<p>"What care I for his clothes, thou goose? Take that,
and heed thine own a bit." And mother gave Annie a
slap which sent her swinging up against Mr. Faggus, and
he caught her, and kissed and protected her; and she
looked at him very nicely, with great tears in her soft
blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, fie upon thee, fie upon thee," cried mother (being
yet more vexed with him, because she had beaten Annie);
"after all we have done for thee, and saved thy worthless
neck&mdash;and to try to kill my son for me! Never more
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
shall horse of thine enter stable here, since these be thy
returns to me. Small thanks to you, John Fry, I say;
much you care for your master's son!"</p>

<p>"Well, missus, what could us do?" began John; "Jan
wudd goo, now wudd't her, Jem? And how was us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jan, indeed! Master John, if you please, to a lad of
his years and stature. And now, Tom Faggus, be off, if
you please, and think yourself lucky to go so."</p>

<p>Everybody looked at mother, to hear her talk like that,
knowing how quiet she was day by day, and how pleasant
to be cheated. And the men began to shoulder their
shovels, both so as to be away from her, and to go and
tell their wives of it. Winnie, too, was looking at her,
being pointed at so much, and wondering if she had done
amiss. And then she came to me, and trembled, and
stooped her head, and asked my pardon, if she had been
too proud with me.</p>

<p>"Winnie shall stop here to-night," said I, for Tom
Faggus still said never a word all the while, but began
to buckle his things on. "Mother, I tell you Winnie
shall stop; else I will go away with her. I never knew
what it was, till now, to ride a horse worth riding."</p>

<p>"Young man," said Tom Faggus, still preparing sternly
to depart, "you know more about a horse than any man
on Exmoor. Your mother may well be proud of you, but
she need have had no fear. As if I, Tom Faggus, your
father's cousin&mdash;and the only thing I am proud of&mdash;would
ever have let you mount my mare, which dukes
and princes have vainly sought, except for the courage
in your eyes, and the look of your father about you. I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
knew you could ride when I saw you, and rarely you
have conquered. But women don't understand us."</p>

<p>With that he fetched a heavy sigh, and feebly got upon
Winnie's back, and she came to say farewell to me. He
lifted his hat to my mother with a glance of sorrow, but
never a word, and to me he said: "Open the gate, Cousin
John, if you please. You have beaten her so, that she
cannot leap it, poor thing."</p>

<p>But, before he was truly gone out of our yard, my
mother came softly after him, with her afternoon apron
across her eyes, and one hand ready to offer him. Nevertheless,
he made as if he had not seen her, though he
let his horse go slowly. "Stop, Cousin Tom," my mother
said, "a word with you before you go."</p>

<p>"Lorna Doone," by Richard Blackmore, from which this
extract is taken, is justly regarded as one of the few really
great romances written in the latter part of the nineteenth
century. It is a story of the times of Charles II., and
culminates about the time of the rebellion of Monmouth
in 1685. The narrative is supposed to be related by a
sturdy farmer of Exmoor, named John Ridd, who is the
hero of the tale. The main part of the action centers
round the deeds of a band of outlaws called the Doones,
who had established themselves in a narrow valley of
Exmoor, from whence they levied tribute upon their
neighbors and bade defiance to the officers of the law.
The quaint and homely style in which the story is written
wins the admiration of all readers, and gives to the work
an indefinable charm.</p>

<h2>THE BATTLE OF BANNOCKBURN.</h2>

<p>The Battle of Bannockburn, in Scotland, was one of
the most famous in history. It was fought June 24th,
1314, between Robert Bruce of Scotland and Edward II.
of England. The army of Bruce consisted of 30,000
men; that of Edward of 100,000, of whom 52,000 were
archers. The story of the battle is thus described by Sir
Walter Scott in his "Tales of a Grandfather":</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Now when Sir Philip Mowbray, the governor of Stirling,
came to London, to tell the King, that Stirling, the
last Scottish town of importance which remained in possession
of the English, was to be surrendered if it were
not relieved by force of arms before midsummer, then all
the English nobles called out, it would be a sin and shame
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
to permit the fair conquest which Edward the First had
made, to be forfeited to the Scots for want of fighting.
It was, therefore, resolved, that the King should go himself
to Scotland, with as great forces as he could possibly
muster.</p>

<p>King Edward the Second, therefore, assembled one of
the greatest armies which a King of England ever commanded.
There were troops brought from all his dominions.
Many brave soldiers from the French provinces
which the King of England possessed in France,&mdash;many
Irish, many Welsh,&mdash;and all the great English nobles and
barons, with their followers, were assembled in one great
army.</p>

<p>King Robert the Bruce summoned all his nobles and
barons to join him, when he heard of the great preparations
which the King of England was making. They
were not so numerous as the English by many thousand
men. In fact, his whole army did not very much exceed
thirty thousand, and they were much worse armed than
the wealthy Englishmen; but then, Robert, who was
at their head, was one of the most expert generals of
the time; and the officers he had under him, were his
brother Edward, his nephew Randolph, his faithful follower
the Douglas, and other brave and experienced leaders,
who commanded the same men that had been
accustomed to fight and gain victories under every disadvantage
of situation and numbers.</p>

<p>The King, on his part, studied how he might supply,
by address and stratagem, what he wanted in numbers
and strength. He knew the superiority of the English,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
both in their heavy-armed cavalry, which were much
better mounted and armed than that of the Scots, and in
their archers, who were better trained than any others in
the world. Both these advantages he resolved to provide
against. With this purpose, he led his army down into a
plain near Stirling, called the Park, near which, and beneath
it, the English army must needs pass through a
boggy country, broken with water courses, while the Scots
occupied hard dry ground. He then caused all the
ground upon the front of his line of battle, where cavalry
were likely to act, to be dug full of holes, about as deep
as a man's knee. They were filled with light brushwood,
and the turf was laid on the top, so that it appeared a
plain field, while in reality it was all full of these pits as
a honeycomb is of holes. He also, it is said, caused steel
spikes, called calthrops, to be scattered up and down in
the plain, where the English cavalry were most likely
to advance, trusting in that manner to lame and destroy
their horses.</p>

<p>When the Scottish army was drawn up, the line stretched
north and south. On the south, it was terminated by
the banks of the brook called Bannockburn, which are so
rocky, that no troops could attack them there. On the
left, the Scottish line extended near to the town of Stirling.
Bruce reviewed his troops very carefully; all the
useless servants, drivers of carts, and such like, of whom
there were very many, he ordered to go behind a height,
afterwards, in memory of the event, called the Gillies'
hill, that is, the Servants' hill. He then spoke to the
soldiers, and expressed his determination to gain the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
victory, or to lose his life on the field of battle. He
desired that all those who did not propose to fight to the
last, should leave the field before the battle began, and
that none should remain except those who were determined
to take the issue of victory or death, as God should
send it.</p>

<p>When the main body of his army was thus placed in
order, the King posted Randolph, with a body of horse,
near to the Church of St. Ninian's, commanding him to
use the utmost diligence to prevent any succors from
being thrown into Stirling Castle. He then dispatched
James of Douglas, and Sir Robert Keith, the Mareschal of
the Scottish army, in order that they might survey, as
nearly as they could, the English force, which was now
approaching from Falkirk. They returned with information,
that the approach of that vast host was one of the
most beautiful and terrible sights which could be seen,&mdash;that
the whole country seemed covered with men at
arms on horse and foot,&mdash;that the number of standards,
banners, and pennons (all flags of different kinds) made so
gallant a show, that the bravest and most numerous host
in Christendom might be alarmed to see King Edward
moving against them.</p>

<p>It was upon the twenty-third of June (1314) the King
of Scotland heard the news, that the English army were
approaching Stirling. He drew out his army, therefore, in
the order which he had before resolved on. After a short
time, Bruce, who was looking out anxiously for the enemy,
saw a body of English cavalry trying to get into Stirling
from the eastward. This was the Lord Clifford, who,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
with a chosen body of eight hundred horse had been
detached to relieve the castle.</p>

<p>"See, Randolph," said the King to his nephew, "there
is a rose fallen from your chaplet." By this he meant
that Randolph had lost some honor, by suffering the
enemy to pass where he had been stationed to hinder
them. Randolph made no reply, but rushed against Clifford
with little more than half his number. The Scots
were on foot. The English turned to charge them with
their lances, and Randolph drew up his men in close order
to receive the onset. He seemed to be in so much danger,
that Douglas asked leave of the King to go and assist
him. The King refused him permission.</p>

<p>"Let Randolph," he said, "redeem his own fault; I
can not break the order of battle for his sake." Still the
danger appeared greater, and the English horse seemed
entirely to encompass the small handful of Scottish infantry.
"So please you," said Douglas to the King, "my
heart will not suffer me to stand idle and see Randolph
perish&mdash;I must go to his assistance." He rode off accordingly;
but long before they had reached the place of
combat, they saw the English horses galloping off, many
with empty saddles.</p>

<p>"Halt!" said Douglas to his men, "Randolph has
gained the day; since we were not soon enough to help
him in the battle, do not let us lessen his glory by approaching
the field." Now, that was nobly done; especially
as Douglas and Randolph were always contending
which should rise highest in the good opinion of the King
and the nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
    The van of the English army now came in sight, and a
number of their bravest knights drew near to see what
the Scots were doing. They saw King Robert dressed in
his armor, and distinguished by a gold crown, which he
wore over his helmet. He was not mounted on his great
war horse, because he did not expect to fight that evening.
But he rode on a little pony up and down the ranks
of his army, putting his men in order, and carried in his
hand a short battle ax made of steel. When the King
saw the English horsemen draw near, he advanced a little
before his own men, that he might look at them more
nearly.</p>

<p>There was a knight among the English, called Sir
Henry de Bohun, who thought this would be a good opportunity
to gain great fame to himself, and put an end
to the war, by killing King Robert. The King being
poorly mounted, and having no lance, Bohun galloped on
him suddenly and furiously, thinking, with his long spear,
and his tall powerful horse, easily to bear him down to
the ground. King Robert saw him, and permitted him
to come very near, then suddenly turned his pony a little
to one side, so that Sir Henry missed him with the lance
point, and was in the act of being carried past him by the
career of his horse. But as he passed, King Robert rose
up in his stirrups, and struck Sir Henry on the head with
his battle ax so terrible a blow, that it broke to pieces
his iron helmet as if it had been a nutshell, and hurled
him from his saddle. He was dead before he reached the
ground. This gallant action was blamed by the Scottish
leaders, who thought Bruce ought not to have exposed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
himself to so much danger, when the safety of the whole
army depended on him. The King only kept looking at
his weapon, which was injured by the force of the blow,
and said, "I have broken my good battle ax."</p>

<p>The next morning, being the twenty-fourth of June, at
break of day, the battle began in terrible earnest. The
English as they advanced saw the Scots getting into line.
The Abbot of Inchaffray walked through their ranks
barefooted, and exhorted them to fight for their freedom.
They kneeled down as he passed, and prayed to heaven
for victory. King Edward, who saw this, called out,
"They kneel down&mdash;they are asking forgiveness."
"Yes," said a celebrated English baron, called Ingelram
de Umphraville, "but they ask it from God, not from us&mdash;these
men will conquer, or die upon the field."</p>

<p>The English King ordered his men to begin the battle.
The archers then bent their bows, and began to shoot so
closely together, that the arrows fell like flakes of snow
on a Christmas day. But Bruce, as I told you before, was
prepared for them. He had in readiness a body of men at
arms well mounted, who rode at full gallop among the
archers, and as they had no weapons save their bows and
arrows, which they could not use when they were attacked
hand to hand, they were cut down in great numbers, and
thrown into total confusion.</p>

<p>The fine English cavalry then advanced to support
their archers, and to attack the Scottish line. But coming
over the ground, which was dug full of pits, the
horses fell into these holes, and the riders lay tumbling
about, without any means of defense, and unable to rise,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
from the weight of their armor. The Englishmen began
to fall into general disorder; and the Scottish King,
bringing up more of his forces, attacked and pressed
them still more closely.</p>

<p>On a sudden, while the battle was obstinately maintained
on both sides, an event happened which decided
the victory. The servants and attendants on the Scottish
camp had, as I told you, been sent behind the army
to a place afterwards called the Gillies' hill. But when
they saw that their masters were likely to gain the day,
they rushed from their place of concealment with such
weapons as they could get, that they might have their
share in the victory and in the spoil. The English, seeing
them come suddenly over the hill, mistook this disorderly
rabble for a new army coming up to sustain the
Scots, and, losing all heart, began to shift every man for
himself. Edward himself left the field as fast as he could
ride. A valiant knight, Sir Giles de Argentine, attended
the King till he got him out of the press of the combat.
But he would retreat no farther. "It is not my custom,"
he said, "to fly." With that he took leave of the King, set
spurs to horse, and calling out his war cry of Argentine!
Argentine! he rushed into the thickest of the Scottish
ranks, and was killed.</p>

<p>Edward first fled to Stirling Castle, and entreated admittance;
but Sir Philip Mowbray, the governor, reminded
the fugitive sovereign that he was obliged to surrender
the castle next day, so Edward was fain to fly through
the Torwood, closely pursued by Douglas with a body of
cavalry. An odd circumstance happened during the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
chase, which showed how loosely some of the Scottish
barons of that day held their political opinions: As
Douglas was riding furiously after Edward, he met a
Scottish knight, Sir Laurence Abernethy, with twenty
horse. Sir Laurence had hitherto owned the English interest,
and was bringing this band of followers to serve
King Edward's army. But learning from Douglas that
the English King was entirely defeated, he changed sides
on the spot, and was easily prevailed upon to join Douglas
in pursuing the unfortunate Edward, with the very followers
whom he had been leading to join his standard.</p>

<p>Douglas and Abernethy followed King Edward as far
as Dunbar, where the English had still a friend, in the
governor, Patrick, Earl of March. The Earl received
Edward in his forlorn condition, and furnished him with a
fishing skiff, or small ship, in which he escaped to England,
having entirely lost his fine army, and a great number of
his bravest nobles.</p>

<p>The English never before or afterwards, whether in
France or Scotland, lost so dreadful a battle as that of
Bannockburn, nor did the Scots ever gain one of the same
importance.</p>
</div>

<p>Such is the story that is told by Sir Walter Scott in his
"Tales of a Grandfather." It will be interesting now to
read Burns's poem beginning, "Scots wha hae wi' Wallace
bled," which we can easily imagine to be Bruce's
address to his men at the beginning of the great fight.
Read also Sir Walter Scott's metrical description of the
battle, in the long poem entitled "The Lord of the Isles."</p>

<h2>BEETHOVEN'S MOONLIGHT SONATA.</h2>

<p>Among the great musical composers of modern times
there have been few who rank with Ludwig van Beethoven.
This famous man was born in Bonn, Germany,
in 1770; he died at Vienna in 1827. It may be truthfully
said that the works of Beethoven created a new epoch in
the history and development of music, and his compositions
lose none of their popularity as the years go by.</p>

<p>Beethoven's life was a sad one. He was alone in the
world, deaf, and the object of unkind treatment by those
who should have been his friends. How nobly he rose above
all petty annoyances, we can readily understand when we
listen to the grand and solemn strains of his immortal
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
music. The following story illustrates the kindliness
of his nature and shows how some of his works seemed
to be almost the result of inspiration.</p>

<p class="cen">*****</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
    <a name="p0079-illus.jpg" id="p0079-illus.jpg"></a>

 <p class="caption2">Ludwig van Beethoven.</p>
</div>
<p>It happened at Bonn. One moonlight winter's evening
I called upon Beethoven; for I wished him to take
a walk, and afterwards sup with me. In passing through
a dark, narrow street, he suddenly paused.
"Hush!" he said, "what sound is that? It
is from my Sonata in F. Hark! how well
it is played!"</p>

<p>It was a little, mean dwelling, and
we paused outside and listened. The
player went on; but, in the midst of
the finale, there was a sudden break;
then the voice of sobbing. "I cannot
play any more. It is so beautiful;
it is utterly beyond my power to do it
justice. Oh, what would I not give
to go to the concert at Cologne!"</p>

<p>"Ah! my sister," said her companion; "why create
regrets when there is no remedy? We can scarcely pay
our rent."</p>

<p>"You are right, and yet I wish for once in my life to
hear some really good music. But it is of no use."</p>

<p>Beethoven looked at me. "Let us go in," he said.</p>

<p>"Go in!" I exclaimed. "What can we go in for?"</p>

<p>"I will play to her," he said, in an excited tone.
"Here is feeling&mdash;genius&mdash;understanding! I will play
to her, and she will understand it."
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
And, before I could prevent him, his hand was upon
the door. It opened, and we entered.</p>

<p>A pale young man was sitting by the table, making
shoes; and near him, leaning sorrowfully upon an old-fashioned
piano, sat a young girl, with a profusion of
light hair falling over her face.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said Beethoven, "but I heard music
and was tempted to enter. I am a musician."</p>

<p>The girl blushed, and the young man looked grave
and somewhat annoyed.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I also overheard something of what you said,"
continued my friend. "You wish to hear&mdash;that is, you
would like&mdash;that is&mdash;shall I play for you?"</p>

<p>There was something so odd in the whole affair, and
something so comical and pleasant in the manner of the
speaker, that the spell was broken in a moment.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the shoemaker; "but our piano is
so wretched, and we have no music."</p>

<p>"No music!" echoed my friend; "how, then, does the
young lady&mdash;" He paused, and colored; for, as he
looked in the girl's face, he saw that she was blind.
"I&mdash;I entreat your pardon," he stammered. "I had not
perceived before. Then you play by ear? But where
do you hear the music, since you frequent no concerts?"</p>

<p>"We lived at Bruhl for two years, and while there,
I used to hear a lady practicing near us. During the
summer evenings her windows were generally open, and
I walked to and fro outside to listen to her."</p>

<p>She seemed so shy that Beethoven said no more, but
seated himself quietly before the piano and began to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
play. He had no sooner struck the first chord than I
knew what would follow. Never, during all the years
I knew him, did I hear him play as he then played to
that blind girl and her brother. He seemed to be inspired;
and, from the instant that his fingers began to
wander along the keys, the very tone of the instrument
seemed to grow sweeter and more equal.</p>

<p>The brother and sister were silent with wonder and
rapture. The former laid aside his work; the latter,
with her head bent slightly forward, and her hands
pressed tightly over her breast, crouched down near the
end of the piano, as if fearful lest even the beating of
her heart should break the flow of those magical sounds.</p>

<p>Suddenly the flame of the single candle wavered, sank,
flickered, and went out. Beethoven paused, and I threw
open the shutters, admitting a flood of brilliant moonlight.
The room was almost as light as before, the
moon's rays falling strongest upon the piano and player.
His head dropped upon his breast; his hands rested
upon his knees; he seemed absorbed in deep thought.
He remained thus for some time. At length the young
shoemaker rose and approached him eagerly.</p>

<p>"Wonderful man!" he said, in a low tone. "Who
and what are you?"</p>

<p>"Listen!" said Beethoven, and he played the opening
bars of the Sonata in F. A cry of recognition burst from
them both, and exclaiming, "Then you are Beethoven!"
they covered his hands with tears and kisses.</p>

<p>He rose to go, but we held him back with entreaties.
"Play to us once more&mdash;only once more!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
    He suffered himself to be led back to the instrument.
The moon shone brightly in through the window, and
lighted up his glorious, ragged head and massive figure.
"I will improvise a Sonata to the Moonlight!" said he,
looking up thoughtfully to the sky and stars. Then his
hands dropped on the keys, and he began playing a sad
and infinitely lovely movement, which crept gently over
the instrument, like the calm flow of moonlight over the
dark earth. This was followed by a wild, elfin passage
in triple time&mdash;a sort of grotesque interlude, like the
dance of sprites upon the lawn. Then came a swift
agitato finale&mdash;a breathless, hurrying, trembling movement,
descriptive of flight, and uncertainty, and vague
impulsive terror, which carried us away on its rustling
wings, and left us all in emotion and wonder.</p>

<p>"Farewell to you!" said Beethoven, pushing back his
chair, and turning toward the door&mdash;"farewell to you!"</p>

<p>"You will come again?" asked they, in one breath.</p>

<p>He paused and looked compassionately, almost tenderly,
at the face of the blind girl.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said hurriedly, "I will come again, and
give the young lady some lessons! Farewell! I will
come again!"</p>

<p>Their looks followed us in silence more eloquent than
words till we were out of sight.</p>

<p>"Let us make haste back," said Beethoven, "that I

<h2>THE STORY OF TEMPE WICK.</h2>

</div>
<p>There are so many curious and unexpected things
which may happen in time of war, especially to people
who live in parts of a country where the enemy may
be expected to come, or where the
friendly army is already encamped,
that it is impossible to guard against
unpleasant occurrences; and it often
happens that the only thing to be
depended upon when an emergency
arises, is presence of mind, and
quickness of wit.</p>

<p>In these qualities, New Jersey
girls have never shown
themselves behind their sisters
of other parts of the country,
and a very good proof of
this is shown by an incident
which took place near Morristown during the time that
the American army was quartered in that neighborhood.</p>

<p>Not far from the town was a farm then known as
Wick's farm, situated in a beautiful wooded country.
The daughter of Mr. Wick, named Tempe (probably
short for Temperance), was the owner of a very fine
horse, and on this beautiful animal it was her delight
to ride over the roads and through the woods of the
surrounding country. She had been accustomed to
horses since she was a child, and was not afraid to ride
anywhere by herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
    When she first began to canter over these hills and
dales, it had been in times of peace, when there was
nothing in this quiet country of which any one might
be afraid; and now, although these were days of war,
she felt no fear. There were soldiers not far away, but
these she looked upon as her friends and protectors;
for Washington and his army had encamped in that
region to defend the country against the approach of
the enemy. If any straggling Redcoats should feel a
desire to come along the hills, they would be very apt
to restrain their inclinations so long as they knew that
that brave American army was encamped near by.</p>

<p>So Miss Tempe Wick, fearing nothing, rode far and
wide, as she had been in the habit of doing, and every
day she and her good steed became better and better
acquainted with each other.</p>

<p>One fine afternoon, as Tempe was slowly riding homeward,
within a mile of her house, she met half a dozen
soldiers in Continental uniform, and two of them, stepping
in front of her, called upon her to stop. When she
had done so, one of them seized her bridle. She did
not know the men; but still, as they belonged to Washington's
army, who were her countrymen and friends,
she saw no reason to be afraid, and asked them what
they wanted.</p>

<p>At first she received no answer, for they were very
busily occupied in looking at her horse and expressing
their satisfaction at the fine points of the animal. Tempe
had had her horse praised before; but these men were
looking at him, and talking about him, very much as if
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
he were for sale and they were thinking of buying.
Presently one of the men said to her that this was a very
excellent horse that she was riding, and they wanted it.
To this Tempe exclaimed, in great amazement, that it
was her own horse, that she wanted him herself, and had
no wish to dispose of him. Some of the soldiers laughed,
and one of them told her that the troops were about to
move, and that good horses were greatly needed, and that
they had orders to levy upon the surrounding country
and take horses wherever they could find them.</p>

<p>Now was Tempe astonished beyond measure. If half
a dozen British soldiers had surrounded her, and had declared
that they intended to rob her of her horse, she
would not have wondered at it, for they would have taken
it as the property of an enemy. But that the soldiers of
her own country, the men on whom she and all her friends
and neighbors depended for protection and safety, should
turn on her and rob her, as if they had been a set
of marauding Hessians, was something she could scarcely
comprehend. But it did not take her long to understand,
that no matter who they were or what they were,&mdash;whether
they thought they had a right to do what
they threatened, or whether they had no regard for right
and justice,&mdash;they were in earnest, and intended to take
her horse. When this conviction flashed into the mind
of Tempe Wick, there also flashed into it a determination
to show these men that a Jersey girl had a will of her
own, and that if they wanted her property, they would
have to do a great deal more than simply to come to her
and ask her to hand it over to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
    After a little parley, during which the man who held
her bridle let go of it, supposing she was about to dismount,
she suddenly gave her spirited horse a sharp cut
with the whip, dashed between two of the soldiers, and
before they could comprehend what had happened she
was off and away.</p>

<p>As fast as they could run, the soldiers followed her,
one or two of them firing their guns in the air, thinking
to frighten her and make her stop; but, as though she
had been a deer and her pursuers ordinary hunters, she
swiftly sped away from them.</p>

<p>But they did not give up the chase. Some of them
knew where this girl lived, and were confident that when
they reached her house, they would have the horse. If
they had known it was such a fine animal, they would
have come after it before. According to their belief,
good horses should go into the army, and people who
staid at home, and expected other people to fight for
them, ought to be willing to do what they could to help
in the good cause, and at least give their horses to the
army.</p>

<p>As Tempe sat upon her bounding steed, she knew very
well that the soldiers could never catch her; but her
heart sank within her as she thought of what would happen
when they came to the farm and demanded her horse.
Running away from them was only postponing her trouble
for a little while, for there was no one about the place
who could prevent those men from going to the barn and
taking away the animal.</p>

<p>It would be of no use to pass her house and ride on and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
on. Where should she go? She must come back sometime,
and all the soldiers would have to do would be to
halt at the farm, and wait until she returned. And even
if she should take her horse into the wood and tie him to
a tree, they would know by her coming back on foot that
she had left him at no great distance, and they would be
sure to follow his tracks and find him.</p>

<p>As Tempe rode swiftly on, her thoughts galloped as
fast as her horse, and before she reached the house she had
come to a conclusion as to the best thing to be done. She
did not ride toward the barn, but dashed through the
gateway of the large yard, and sprang from her steed.
As she turned in, she looked down the road; but the
men were not in sight. What she was going to do was
something which people never did, but it was the only
thing she could think of, and she was a girl whose actions
were as quick as her ideas were original. Without stopping
an instant, she took her horse to the back door, and
led him boldly into the house.</p>

<p>This was not the sort of stable to which Tempe's horse
or any other American horse was accustomed; but this
animal knew his mistress, and where she led, he was willing
to follow. If one of the farm hands had attempted
to take the creature into the house, there would probably
have been some rearing and plunging; but nothing of
this kind happened as our Jersey girl, with her hand on
her horse's bridle, led him quickly inside and closed the
door behind him. As the story goes, she took him
through the kitchen, and then into the parlor, without
the slightest regard to the injury his shoes might do to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the well-kept floor; and from the parlor she led him into
a bedroom on the lower floor, which was usually used as a
guest chamber, but which never before had such a guest
as this.</p>

<p>This room had but a single window, the shutters of
which were kept closed when it was not in use, and there
was no entrance to it except through the door which
opened from the parlor. The door was quickly closed,
and Tempe stood with her horse in the darkness.</p>

<p>When the soldiers reached the farm they went to the
barn. They examined the outhouses, visited the pasture
fields, and made a thorough search, high and low, near
and far; but no sign of a horse could they find. Of
course, the notion that the animal was concealed in the
house did not enter their minds, and the only way in
which they could account for the total disappearance of
the horse was, that Tempe had ridden off with him&mdash;where
they knew not. We do not know how long they
waited for the sight of a hungry horse coming home to
his supper, but we do know that while there was the
slightest danger of her dear horse being taken away
from her, that animal remained a carefully attended guest
in the spare room of the Wick house; and the tradition
is, that he staid there three weeks. There Tempe waited
on him as if he had been a visitor of high degree; and if
she was afraid to go to the barn to bring him hay and
oats, she doubtless gave him biscuit and soft bread,&mdash;dainties
of which a horse is very fond, especially when
they are brought to him by such a kind mistress as
Tempe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]<br />[Pg 90]</a></span>
    When the cavalry moved away from their camp near
Morristown, no one of them rode on that fine horse on
which they had seen a girl gayly cantering, and which,
when they had been about to put their hands upon it, had
flown away, like a butterfly from under the straw hat of a
schoolboy. When the troops were gone, the horse came
out of the guest chamber and went back to his stall in the
stable; and that room in which he passed so many quiet
days, and the door through which the horse timidly
stepped under the shadow of that hospitable roof, are still
to be seen at the old Wick house, which stands now, as it
stood then, with its shaded yard and the great willow tree
behind it, on the pleasant country road by which we may
drive from Morristown to Mendham by the way of
Washington Corner.</p>

<h2>LIFE IN NORMAN ENGLAND.</h2>

<p>The tall frowning keep and solid walls of the great
stone castles, in which the Norman barons lived, betokened
an age of violence and suspicion. Beauty gave
way to the needs of safety. Girdled with its green and
slimy ditch, round the inner edge of which ran a parapeted
wall pierced along the top with shot holes, stood
the buildings, spreading often over many acres.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">

 <p class="caption2">From a Photograph.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engraved by John Evans.<br />
                     Ruins of a Norman Castle.</p>
</div>

<p>If an enemy managed to cross the moat and force the
gateway, in spite of a portcullis crashing from above, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
melted lead pouring in burning streams from the perforated
top of the rounded arch, but little of his work was
yet done; for the keep lifted its huge angular block of
masonry within the inner bailey or courtyard, and from
the narrow chinks in its ten-foot wall rained a sharp incessant
shower of arrows, sweeping all approaches to the
high and narrow stair, by which alone access could be
had to its interior.</p>

<p>These loopholes were the only windows, except in the
topmost story, where the chieftain, like a vulture in his
rocky nest, watched all the surrounding country. The
day of splendid oriels had not yet come in castle architecture.</p>

<p>Thus a baron in his keep could defy, and often did
defy, the king upon his throne. Under his roof, eating
daily at his board, lived a throng of armed retainers;
and around his castle lay farms tilled by martial franklins,
who at his call laid aside their implements of husbandry,
took up the sword and spear, which they could
wield with equal skill, and marched beneath his banner to
the war.</p>

<p>With robe ungirt and head uncovered each tenant had
done homage and sworn an oath of fealty, placing his
joined hands between those of the sitting baron, and
humbly saying as he knelt, "I become your man from
this day forward, of life and limb and of earthly worship;
and unto you I shall be true and faithful, and bear to you
faith for the tenements that I claim to hold of you, saving
the faith that I owe unto our sovereign lord the king."
A kiss from the baron completed the ceremony.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
    <a name="p0092-illus.jpg" id="p0092-illus.jpg"></a>

 <p class="caption2">Horn Lantern.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
    The furniture of a Norman keep was not unlike that
of an English house. There was richer ornament&mdash;more
elaborate carving. A <i>faldestol</i>, the original of our arm-chair,
spread its drapery and cushions for the chieftain in
his lounging moods. His bed now boasted curtains and
a roof, although, like the English lord, he still lay only
upon straw. Chimneys tunneled the thick walls, and
the cupboards glittered with glass and silver. Horn
lanterns and the old spiked candlesticks lit up
his evening hours, when the chessboard arrayed
its clumsy men, carved out of walrus tusk,
then commonly called whale's-bone. But
the baron had an unpleasant trick of breaking
the chessboard on his opponent's head,
when he found himself checkmated; which
somewhat marred said opponent's enjoyment
of the game. Dice of horn and bone emptied
many a purse in Norman England.</p>

<p>Dances and music whiled away the long winter
nights; and on summer evenings the castle courtyards
resounded with the noise of football, <i>kayles</i> (a sort
of ninepins), wrestling, boxing, leaping, and the fierce
joys of the bull bait. But out of doors, when no fighting
was on hand, the hound, the hawk, and the lance
attracted the best energies and skill of the Norman
gentleman.</p>

<p>Rousing the forest game with dogs, they shot at it
with barbed and feathered arrows. A field of ripening
corn never turned the chase aside: it was one privilege of
a feudal baron to ride as he pleased over his tenants'
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
crops, and another to quarter his insolent hunting train
in the farmhouses which pleased him best! The elaborate
details of <i>woodcraft</i> became an important part of a
noble boy's education; for the numerous bugle calls and
scientific dissection of a dead stag took many seasons to
learn.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">

    <img src="images/p0093-illus.jpg" width="150" height="333" alt="A hooded bird" title="" />
 <p class="caption2">The Hawk.</p>
</div>
<p>After the Conquest, to kill a deer or own a hawk came
more than ever to be regarded as the special privilege of
the aristocracy. The hawk, daintily dressed, as befitted
the companion of nobility, with his head wrapped
in an embroidered hood, and a peal of silver bells
tinkling from his rough legs, sat in state, bound
with leathern jesses to the wrist, which was protected
by a thick glove. The ladies and the clergy
loved him. By many a mere the abbots ambled
on their ponies over the swampy soil, and sweet
shrill voices cheered the long-winged hawk, as he
darted off in pursuit of the soaring quarry.</p>

<p>The author of "Ivanhoe" has made the tournament
a picture familiar to all readers of romance. It
therefore needs no long description here. It was held
in honor of some great event&mdash;a coronation, wedding,
or victory. Having practiced well during squirehood
at the <i>quintain</i>, the knight, clad in full armor, with
visor barred and the colors of his lady on crest and
scarf, rode into the lists, for which some level green was
chosen and surrounded with a palisade.</p>

<p>For days before, his shield had been hanging in a neighboring
church, as a sign of his intention to compete in
this great game of chivalry. If any stain lay on his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
knighthood, a lady, by touching the suspended shield
with a wand, could debar him from a share in the jousting.
And if, when he had entered the lists he was rude
to a lady, or broke in any way the etiquette of the tilt
yard, he was beaten from the lists with the ashwood
lances of the knights.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
    <a name="p0094-illus.jpg" id="p0094-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p0094-illus.jpg" width="200" height="307" alt="A man in armor" title="" />
 <p class="caption2">The Knight.</p>
</div>
<p>The simple joust was the shock
of two knights, who galloped with
leveled spears at each other, aiming
at breast or head, with the
object either of unhorsing the antagonist,
or, if he sat his charger
well, of splintering the lance upon
his helmet or his shield. The
mellay hurled together, at the
dropping of the prince's baton,
two parties of knights, who
hacked away at each other with
ax and mace and sword, often
gashing limbs and breaking bones
in the wild excitement of the
fray. Bright eyes glanced from
the surrounding galleries upon the brutal sport; and
when the victor, with broken plume, and battered armor,
dragged his weary limbs to the footstool of the beauty
who presided as Queen over the festival, her white hands
decorated him with the meed of his achievements.</p>

<p>The Normans probably dined at nine in the morning.
When they rose they took a light meal; and ate something
also after their day's work, immediately before going
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
to bed. Goose and garlic formed a favorite dish. Their
cookery was more elaborate, and, in comparison, more
delicate, than the preparations for an English feed; but
the character for temperance, which they brought with
them from the Continent, soon vanished.</p>

<p>The poorer classes hardly ever ate flesh, living principally
on bread, butter, and cheese,&mdash;a social fact which
seems to underlie that usage of our tongue by which the
living animals in field or stall bore English names&mdash;ox,
sheep, calf, pig, deer; while their flesh, promoted to Norman
dishes, rejoiced in names of French origin&mdash;beef,
mutton, veal, pork, venison. Round cakes, piously
marked with a cross, piled the tables, on which pastry
of various kinds also appeared. In good houses cups of
glass held the wine, which was borne from the cellar
below in jugs.</p>

<p>Squatted around the door or on the stair leading to
the Norman dining hall, was a crowd of beggars or
lickers, who grew so insolent in the days of Rufus, that
ushers, armed with rods, were posted outside to beat back
the noisy throng, who thought little of snatching the
dishes as the cooks carried them to table!</p>

<p>The juggler, who under the Normans filled the place
of the English gleeman, tumbled, sang, and balanced
knives in the hall; or out in the bailey of an afternoon
displayed the acquirements of his trained monkey or bear.
The fool, too, clad in colored patchwork, cracked his
ribald jokes and shook his cap and bells at the elbow of
roaring barons, when the board was spread and the circles
of the wine began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
    While knights hunted in the greenwood or tilted in the
lists, and jugglers tumbled in the noisy hall, the monk in
the quiet scriptorium compiled chronicles of passing
events, copied valuable manuscripts, and painted rich
borders and brilliant initials on every page. These illuminations
form a valuable set of materials for our pictures
of life in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Monasteries served many useful purposes at the time of
which I write. Besides their manifest value as centers of
study and literary work, they gave alms to the poor, a
supper and a bed to travelers; their tenants were better
off and better treated than the tenants of the nobles; the
monks could store grain, grow apples, and cultivate their
flower beds with little risk of injury from war, because
they had spiritual thunders at their call, which awed even
the most reckless of the soldiery into a respect for sacred
property.</p>

<p>Splendid structures those monasteries generally were,
since that vivid taste for architecture which the Norman
possessed in a high degree, and which could not find room
for its display in the naked strength of the solid keep,
lavished its entire energy and grace upon buildings lying
in the safe shadow of the Cross. Nor was architectural
taste the only reason for their magnificence. Since they
were nearly all erected as offerings to Heaven, the religion
of the age impelled the pious builders to spare no cost in
decorating the exterior with fretwork and sculpture of
Caen stone, the interior with gilded cornices and windows
of painted glass.</p>

<p>As schools, too, the monasteries did no trifling service
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
to society in the Middle Ages. In addition to their influence
as great centers of learning, English law had enjoined
every mass priest to keep a school in his parish church,
where all the young committed to his care might be instructed.
This custom continued long after the Norman
Conquest. In the Trinity College Psalter we have a picture
of a Norman school, where the pupils sit in a circular
row around the master as he lectures to them from a long
roll of manuscript. Two writers sit by the desk, busy
with copies resembling that which the teacher holds.</p>

<p>The youth of the middle classes, destined for the cloister
or the merchant's stall, chiefly thronged these schools.
The aristocracy cared little for book-learning. Very few
indeed of the barons could read or write. But all could
ride, fence, tilt, play, and carve extremely well; for to
these accomplishments many years of pagehood and
squirehood were given.</p>

<p class="cen">*****</p>

<p>The foregoing description of manners and customs
during the age of feudalism has been adapted from
a popular "History of England," by W. F. Collier. A
much fuller description may be found in Knight's "History
of England," and in Green's "Short History of the
English People." The period described was in many
respects the most romantic in the history of the world,
and many delightful and instructive books have been
written concerning it. Read Scott's "Ivanhoe" and
"The Talisman." Reference may also be had to Pauli's
"Pictures of Old England," and Jusserand's "English
Wayfaring Life in the Middle Ages."</p>

<h2>A PATRIARCH OF THE OLDEN TIME</h2>

<p>Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when
God preserved me; when his candle shined upon my
head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;
as I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of
God was upon my tabernacle; when the Almighty was
yet with me; when my children were about me; when I
washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me
out rivers of oil.</p>

<p>When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when
the eye saw me, it gave witness to me: because I delivered
the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that
had none to help him. The blessing of him that was
ready to perish came upon me; and I caused the widow's
heart to sing for joy. I was eyes to the blind, and feet
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
was I to the lame. I was a father to the poor; and the
cause which I knew not, I searched out.</p>

<p>Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? Was not
my soul grieved for the poor? Let me be weighed in an
even balance that God may know mine integrity. If I
did despise the cause of my man servant or of my maid
servant, when they contended with me, what then shall I
do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what
shall I answer him? Did not he that made me make
him also?</p>

<p>If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have
caused the eyes of the widow to fail, or have eaten my
morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten
thereof; if I have seen any perish for want of clothing,
or any poor without covering; if his loins have not blessed
me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my
sheep; if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,
when I saw my help in the gate; then let mine arm fall
from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from
the bone.</p>

<p>If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me,
or lifted up myself when evil found him (neither have
I suffered my mouth to sin, by wishing a curse to his soul.
The stranger did not lodge in the street; but I opened
my doors to the traveler). If my land cry against me, or
the furrows likewise thereof complain; if I have eaten
the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the
owners thereof to lose their life: let thistles grow instead
of wheat, and cockle instead of barley.</p>

<h2>HOW CORTÉS ENTERED THE CITY OF MEXICO.</h2>

 <p class="caption2">William H. Prescott.</p>
</div>
<p>Mexico, when first discovered by
Europeans, was inhabited by a civilized
race called Aztecs. The conquest
of that country and the
subjugation of its people by the
Spaniards under Hernando
Cortés, in 1518&ndash;21, was one
of the most remarkable episodes
in the history of the
Western Continent. William
H. Prescott, our American
historian, in his "Conquest of
Mexico," has told the story of
that event in a manner so delightful that the whole
narrative reads like a romance. His description of the
entry of the Spaniards into the capital city of the Aztecs
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It was the eighth of November, 1519, a conspicuous
day in history, as that on which the Europeans first set
foot in the capital of the Western World.</p>

<p>Cortés with his little body of horse formed a sort of
advanced guard to the army. Then came the Spanish
infantry, who in a summer's campaign had acquired the
discipline and the weather-beaten aspect of veterans.
The baggage occupied the center; and the rear was
closed by the dark files of Tlascalan warriors. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
whole number must have fallen short of seven thousand;
of which fewer than four hundred were Spaniards.</p>

<p>Everywhere the conquerors beheld the evidence of a
crowded and thriving population, exceeding all they had
yet seen. The temples and principal buildings of the
cities were covered with a hard white stucco, which
glistened like enamel in the level beams of the morning.
The margin of the lake was thickly gemmed with towns
and hamlets. The water was darkened by swarms of
canoes filled with Indians, who clambered up the sides
of the causeway and gazed with curious astonishment
on the strangers. And here, also, they beheld those
fairy islands of flowers, overshadowed occasionally by
trees of considerable size, rising and falling with the
gentle undulation of the billows.</p>

<p>At the distance of half a league from the capital, they
encountered a solid work, or curtain of stone, which
traversed the dike. It was twelve feet high, was
strengthened by towers at the extremities, and in the
center was a battlemented gateway, which opened a
passage to the troops.</p>

<p>Here they were met by several hundred Aztec chiefs,
who came out to announce the approach of Montezuma
and to welcome the Spaniards to his capital. They were
dressed in the fanciful gala costume of the country, with
the <i>maxlatl</i>, or cotton sash, around their loins, and a
broad mantle of the same material, or of the brilliant
feather embroidery, flowing gracefully down their shoulders.
On their necks and arms they displayed collars and
bracelets of turquoise mosaic, with which delicate plumage
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
was curiously mingled, while their ears and underlips,
and occasionally their noses, were garnished with pendants
formed of precious stones, or crescents of fine gold.</p>

<p>As each cacique made the usual formal salutation of
the country separately to the general, the tedious ceremony
delayed the march more than an hour. After
this the army experienced no further interruption till
it reached a bridge near the gates of the city. It was
built of wood, and was thrown across an opening of
the dike, which furnished an outlet to the waters when
agitated by the winds or swollen by a sudden influx in
the rainy season. It was a drawbridge; and the Spaniards,
as they crossed it, felt how truly they were committing
themselves to the mercy of Montezuma, who,
by thus cutting off their communications with the
country, might hold them prisoners in his capital.</p>

<p>In the midst of these unpleasant reflections, they beheld
the glittering retinue of the emperor emerging
from the great street which led then, as it still does,
through the heart of the city. Amidst a crowd of
Indian nobles, preceded by three officers of state bearing
golden wands, they saw the royal palanquin blazing
with burnished gold. It was borne on the shoulders of
nobles, and over it a canopy of gaudy feather work, powdered
with jewels and fringed with silver, was supported
by four attendants of the same rank. They were barefooted,
and walked with a slow, measured pace, and with
eyes bent on the ground.</p>

<p>When the train had come within a convenient distance,
it halted, and Montezuma, descending from his litter,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
came forward, leaning on the arms of the lords of
Tezcuco and Iztapalapan, his nephew and brother, both
of whom had already been made known to the Spaniards.
As the monarch advanced under the canopy, the obsequious
attendants strewed the ground with cotton tapestry,
that his imperial feet might not be contaminated by
the rude soil. His subjects of high and low degree, who
lined the sides of the causeway, bent forward with their
eyes fastened on the ground as he passed, and some of
the humbler class prostrated themselves before him.</p>

<p>Montezuma wore the girdle and ample square cloak, <i>tilmatli</i>,
of his nation. It was made of the finest cotton, with
the embroidered ends gathered in a knot round his neck.
His feet were defended by sandals having soles of gold,
and the leathern thongs which bound them to his ankles
were embossed with the same metal. Both the cloak and
sandals were sprinkled with pearls and precious stones,
among which the emerald, and another green stone of
high estimation among the Aztecs, were conspicuous.
On his head he wore no other ornament than a <i>panache</i>
of plumes of the royal green, which floated down his
back, the badge of military, rather than of regal, rank.</p>

<p>He was at this time about forty years of age. His
person was tall and thin, but not ill made. His hair,
which was black and straight, was not very long; to wear
it short was considered unbecoming to persons of rank.
His beard was thin; his complexion somewhat paler than
is often found in his dusky, or rather copper-colored, race.
His features, though serious in their expression, did not
wear the look of melancholy, indeed of dejection, which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
characterizes his portrait, and which may well have settled
on them at a later period. He moved with dignity, and
his whole demeanor, tempered by an expression of benignity
not to have been anticipated from the reports circulated
of his character, was worthy of a great prince.</p>

<p>The army halted as he drew near. Cortés, dismounting,
threw his reins to a page, and supported by a few
of the principal cavaliers, advanced to meet him. The
interview must have been one of uncommon interest to
both. In Montezuma, Cortés beheld the lord of the
broad realms he had traversed, whose magnificence and
power had been the burden of every tongue. In the
Spaniard, on the other hand, the Aztec prince saw the
strange being whose history seemed to be so mysteriously
connected with his own; the predicted one of his oracles,
whose achievements proclaimed him something more than
human.</p>

<p>But whatever may have been the monarch's feelings,
he so far suppressed them as to receive his guest with
princely courtesy, and to express his satisfaction at personally
seeing him in his capital. Cortés responded by
the most profound expressions of respect, while he made
ample acknowledgments for the substantial proofs which
the emperor had given the Spaniards of his munificence.
He then hung round Montezuma's neck a sparkling chain
of colored crystal, accompanying this with a movement as
if to embrace him, when he was restrained by the two
Aztec lords, shocked at the menaced profanation of the
sacred person of their master. After the interchange of
these civilities, Montezuma appointed his brother to conduct
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the Spaniards to their residence in the capital, and,
again entering his litter, was borne off amidst prostrate
crowds in the same state in which he had come. The
Spaniards quickly followed, and, with colors flying and
music playing, soon made their entrance into the southern
quarter of Tenochtitlan.</p>

<p>Here, again, they found fresh cause for admiration in
the grandeur of the city and the superior style of its
architecture. The dwellings of the poorer class were,
indeed, chiefly of reeds and mud. But the great avenue
through which they were now marching was lined with
the houses of the nobles, who were encouraged by the
emperor to make the capital their residence. They were
built of a red porous stone drawn from quarries in the
neighborhood, and, though they rarely rose to a second
story, often covered a large space of ground. The flat
roofs, <i>azoteas</i>, were protected by stone parapets, so that
every house was a fortress. Sometimes these roofs resembled
parterres of flowers, so thickly were they covered
with them, but more frequently these were cultivated in
broad terraced gardens, laid out between the edifices.
Occasionally a great square or market place intervened,
surrounded by its porticoes of stone and stucco; or a
pyramidal temple reared its colossal bulk, crowned with
its tapering sanctuaries, and altars blazing with inextinguishable
fires. The great street facing the southern
causeway, unlike most others in the place, was wide, and
extended some miles in nearly a straight line, as before
noticed, through the center of the city. A spectator
standing at one end of it, as his eye ranged along the deep
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
vista of temples, terraces, and gardens, might clearly discern
the other, with the blue mountains in the distance,
which, in the transparent atmosphere of the table-land,
seemed almost in contact with the buildings.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">

    <img src="images/p0110-illus.jpg" width="200" height="203" alt="Cortés's portrait" title="" />
 <p class="caption2">Hernando Cortés.</p>
</div>
<p>But what most impressed the Spaniards was the throngs
of people who swarmed through the streets and on the
canals, filling every doorway and window and clustering
on the roofs of the buildings. "I well remember the
spectacle," exclaims Bernal Diaz; "it seems now, after so
many years, as present to my mind
as if it were but yesterday." But
what must have been the sensations
of the Aztecs themselves, as they
looked on the portentous pageant!
as they heard, now
for the first time, the well-cemented
pavement ring under
the iron tramp of the
horses,&mdash;the strange animals
which fear had clothed in
such supernatural terrors: as
they gazed on the children of
the East, revealing their celestial origin in their fair complexions;
saw the bright falchions and bonnets of steel, a
metal to them unknown, glancing like meteors in the sun,
while sounds of unearthly music&mdash;at least, such as their
rude instruments had never wakened&mdash;floated in the air?</p>

<p>As they passed down the spacious street, the troops
repeatedly traversed bridges suspended above canals,
along which they saw the Indian barks gliding swiftly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
with their little cargoes of fruits and vegetables for the
markets of Tenochtitlan. At length they halted before a
broad area near the center of the city, where rose the
huge pyramidal pile dedicated to the patron war god of
the Aztecs, second only, in size as well as sanctity, to the
temple of Cholula, and covering the same ground now in
part occupied by the great cathedral of Mexico.</p>

<p>Facing the western gate of the inclosure of the temple,
stood a low range of stone buildings, spreading over a
wide extent of ground, the palace of Axayacatl, Montezuma's
father, built by that monarch about fifty years
before. It was appropriated as the barracks of the Spaniards.
The emperor himself was in the courtyard, waiting
to receive them. Approaching Cortés, he took from
a vase of flowers, borne by one of his slaves, a massy
collar, in which the shell of a species of crawfish, much
prized by the Indians, was set in gold and connected by
heavy links of the same metal. From this chain depended
eight ornaments, also of gold, made in resemblance of the
same shellfish, a span in length each, and of delicate
workmanship; for the Aztec goldsmiths were confessed
to have shown skill in their craft not inferior to their
brethren of Europe. Montezuma, as he hung the gorgeous
collar round the general's neck, said, "This palace belongs
to you, Malinche" (the epithet by which he always
addressed him), "and your brethren. Rest after your
fatigues, for you have much need to do so, and in a little
while I will visit you again." So saying, he withdrew
with his attendants, evincing in this act a delicate consideration
not to have been expected in a barbarian.</p>

<p>A blade of grass is a mystery, if men would but distill
it out. When my learned friend Dr. Syntax, glancing
round my workroom, observed a vase full of tadpoles, he
asked me in a tone of sniffling superiority:
"Do you really mean to say
you find any interest in those little
beasts?"</p>

<p>"As much as you find in
books," I answered, with some
energy.</p>

<p>"H'm," grunted Syntax.</p>

<p>Very absurd isn't it? But
we all have our hobbies. I can
pass a bookstall on which I perceive
that the ignorance of the
bookseller permits him to exhibit
now and then rare editions of
valuable books at almost no price at all. The sight gives me
no thrill&mdash;it does not even cause me to slacken my pace.</p>

<p>But I can't so easily pass a pond in which I see a shoal
of tadpoles swimming about, as ignorant of their own
value as the bookseller is of his books. I may walk on,
but the sight has sent a slight electric shock through me.</p>

<p>"Why, sir," I said to my learned friend, "there is
more to me in the <i>tail</i> of one of those tadpoles than in all
the musty old volumes you so much delight to pick up.
But I won't thrash your dog unless you thrash mine."</p>

<p>"Why, what on earth can you do with the tail?"</p>

    "Do with it? Study it, experiment on it, put it under
the microscope, and day by day watch the growth of its
various parts. At first it is little more than a mass of
cells. Then I notice that these cells begin to take a
definite shape, and blood vessels
appear in them. Then the muscles
begin to appear."</p>

<p>"Very interesting, I dare
say."</p>

<p>"You don't seem to think
so, by your tone. But look in
this vase: here are several tadpoles
with the most apologetic
of tails&mdash;mere stumps, in fact.
I cut them off nine days ago."</p>

<p>"Will they grow again?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly; for, although the frog dispenses with a
tail almost as soon as he reaches the frog form, the
tadpole needs his tail to swim with; and when by
any accident he loses it, Nature kindly supplies him
with another."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," added Syntax, glad to feel himself once
more among things of which he knew something; "just
like the lobster or the crab, you know. They tear off
their legs and arms in a most reckless way, and yet they
always grow new ones again."</p>

<p>"Would you like to know what has become of the
tails which I cut off from these fellows?"</p>

<p>"Aren't they dead?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. Alive and kicking."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
    "Alive after nine days? Oh! oh!"</p>

<p>"Here they are, in this glass. It is exactly nine days
since they were cut off, and I have been watching them
daily under the microscope. I assure you that I have
seen them <i>grow</i>, not <i>larger</i>, indeed, but develop more and
more, muscle fibers appearing each day where before there
were none at all."</p>

<p>"Come, now, you are trying to see what a fool you can
make of me."</p>

<p>"I am perfectly serious. The discovery is none of
mine. It was made by M. Vulpian in Paris. He says
that the tails live many days&mdash;as many as eighteen in
one instance; but I have never kept mine alive more
than eleven. He says, moreover, that they not only
grow, as I have said, but that they seem to possess feeling,
for they twist about with a rapid swimming movement
when irritated."</p>

<p>"Well, but I say, how <i>could</i> they live when separated
from the body? Our arms or legs don't live; the lobster's
legs don't live."</p>

<p>"Quite true. But in those cases we have limbs of a
complex organization, which require a complex apparatus
in order to sustain their life. They must have blood, the
blood must circulate."</p>

<p>"Stop, stop! I don't want to understand why our
arms can't live apart from our bodies. They don't. The
fact is enough for me. I want to know why the tail of a
tadpole can live apart from the body."</p>

<p>"It <i>can</i>. Is not the fact enough for you in that case
also? Well, I was going to tell you the reason. The tail
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
will live apart from the body only so long as it retains its
early immature form. If you cut it off from a tadpole
which is old enough to have lost its external gills a week
or more, the tail will <i>not</i> live more than three or four
days. And every tail will die as soon as it reaches the
point in its development which requires the circulation of
the blood as a necessary condition."</p>

<p>"But where does it get food?"</p>

<p>"That is more than I can say. I don't know that it
wants food. You know that reptiles can live without
food a wonderful length of time."</p>

<p>"Really, I begin to think there is more in these little
beasts than I ever dreamed of. But it must take a great
deal of study to get at these facts."</p>

<p>"Not more than to get at any of the other open secrets
of Nature. But, since you are interested, look at these
tails as the tadpoles come bobbing against the side of
the glass. Do you see how they are covered with little
white spots?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Look closer. All over the tail there are tiny, cotton-like
spots. Take a lens, if your eye isn't sharp enough.
There, now you see them."</p>

<p>"Yes; I see a sort of <i>fluff</i> scattered about."</p>

<p>"That fluff is an immense colony of parasites. Let us
place the tadpole under the microscope, and you will see
each spot turn out to be a multitude of elegant and active
animals, having bodies not unlike a crystal goblet supported
on an extremely long and flexible stem, and
having round their rim or mouth a range of long, delicate
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
hairs, the motion of which gives a wheel-like aspect,
and makes an eddy in the water which brings food to the
animal."</p>

<p>"This is really interesting! How active they are!
How they shrink up, and then, unwinding their twisted
stems, expand again! What's the name of this thing?"</p>

<p>"<i>Vorticella</i>. It may be found growing on water fleas,
plants, decayed wood, or these tadpoles. People who
study the animalcules are very fond of this Vorticella."</p>

<p>"Well, I never could have believed such a patch of
fluff could turn out a sight like this: I could watch it
for an hour. But what are those small yellowish things
sticking on the side of these parasites?"</p>

<p>"Those, my dear Syntax, are also parasites."</p>

<p>"What, parasites living on parasites?"</p>

<p>"Why not? Nature is economical. Don't you live on
beef, and mutton, and fish? Don't these beeves, muttons,
and fishes live on vegetables
and animals?
Don't the vegetables
and animals live on
other organic matters?
Eat and be eaten, is one
law: live and let live,
is another."</p>

<p>The learned Doctor remained thoughtful; then he
screwed up one side of his face into the most frightful
wrinkles, while with the eye of the other he resumed his
examination of the Vorticella.</p>

<h2>THE SHIPWRECK.</h2>

<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Having made up my mind to go down to Yarmouth,
I went round to the coach office and took the box seat on
the mail. In the evening I started,
by that conveyance, down the road.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
    <a name="p0121-illus.jpg" id="p0121-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p0121-illus.jpg" width="200" height="211" alt="Author's portrait" title="" />
 <p class="caption2">Charles Dickens.</p>
</div>
<p>"Don't you think that a very
remarkable sky?" I asked the
coachman, in the first stage
out of London. "I don't
remember to have seen one
like it."</p>

<p>"Nor I&mdash;not equal to it,"
he replied. "That's wind,
sir; there'll be mischief
done at sea, I expect before
long."</p>

<p>It was a murky confusion&mdash;here
and there blotted with a color like the color of
the smoke from damp fuel&mdash;of flying clouds tossed up
into most remarkable heaps, suggesting greater heights
in the clouds than there were depths below them to the
bottom of the deepest hollows in the earth, through which
the wild moon seemed to plunge headlong, as if, in a
dread disturbance of the laws of nature, she had lost her
way and were frightened. There had been wind all day;
and it was rising then, with an extraordinary great sound.
In another hour it had much increased, and the sky was
more overcast, and it blew harder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
    But as the night advanced, the clouds closing in and
densely overspreading the whole sky, then very dark, it
came on to blow harder and harder. It still increased,
until our horses could scarcely face the wind. Many
times in the dark part of the night (it was then late in
September, when the nights were not short) the leaders
turned about, or came to a dead stop; and we were often
in apprehension that the coach would be blown over.</p>

<p>When the day broke, it blew harder and harder. I
had been in Yarmouth when the seamen said it blew
great guns, but I had never known the like of this, or
anything approaching to it. We came to Ipswich&mdash;very
late, having had to fight every inch of ground since we
were ten miles out of London; and found a cluster of
people in the market place, who had risen from their beds
in the night, fearful of falling chimneys. Some of these,
congregating about the innyard while we changed horses,
told us of great sheets of lead having been ripped off a
high church tower and flung into a by-street, which they
then blocked up. Others had to tell of country people,
coming in from neighboring villages, who had seen great
trees lying torn out of the earth, and whole ricks scattered
about the roads and fields. Still there was no
abatement in the storm, but it blew harder.</p>

<p>As we struggled on, nearer and nearer to the sea,
from which the mighty wind was blowing dead on shore,
its force became more and more terrific. Long before we
saw the sea, its spray was on our lips, and showered salt
rain upon us. The water was out, over miles and miles
of the flat country adjacent to Yarmouth; and every
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
sheet and puddle lashed its banks, and had its stress of
little breakers setting heavily towards us. When we
came within sight of the sea, the waves on the horizon,
caught at intervals above the rolling abyss, were like
glimpses of another shore with towers and buildings.
When at last we got into the town, the people came
out to their doors, all aslant, and with streaming hair,
making a wonder of the mail that had come through such
a night.</p>

<p>I put up at the old inn, and went down to look at the
sea, staggering along the street, which was strewn with
sand and seaweed, and with flying blotches of sea foam;
afraid of falling slates and tiles; and holding by people
I met at angry corners. Coming near the beach, I saw,
not only the boatmen, but half the people of the town,
lurking behind buildings; some now and then braving the
fury of the storm to look away to sea, and blown sheer
out of their course in trying to get zigzag back.</p>

<p>Joining these groups, I found bewailing women whose
husbands were away in herring or oyster boats, which
there was too much reason to think might have foundered
before they could run in anywhere for safety. Grizzled
old sailors were among the people, shaking their heads
as they looked from water to sky, and muttering to
one another; shipowners excited and uneasy; children
huddling together, and peering into older faces; even
stout mariners disturbed and anxious, leveling their
glasses at the sea from behind places of shelter, as if they
were surveying an enemy.</p>

<p>The tremendous sea itself, when I could find sufficient
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
pause to look at it, in the agitation of the blinding
wind, the flying stones and sand, and the awful noise,
confounded me. As the high watery walls came rolling
in, and, at their highest, tumbled into surf, they looked
as if the least would engulf the town. As the receding
wave swept back with a hoarse roar, it seemed to scoop
out caves in the beach, as if its purpose were to undermine
the earth. When some white-headed billows thundered
on, and dashed themselves to pieces before they
reached the land, every fragment of the late whole
seemed possessed by the full might of its wrath, rushing
to be gathered to the composition of another monster.
Undulating hills were changed to valleys, undulating
valleys (with a storm bird sometimes skimming through
them) were lifted up to hills; masses of water shivered
and shook the beach with a booming sound; every shape
tumultuously rolled on, as soon as made, to change its
shape and place, and beat another shape and place
away; the ideal shore on the horizon, with its towers
and buildings, rose and fell; the clouds flew fast and
thick; I seemed to see a rending and upheaving of all
nature.</p>

<p>Not finding my old friend, Ham, among the people
whom this memorable wind&mdash;for it is still remembered
down there as the greatest ever known to blow upon
that coast&mdash;had brought together, I made my way to
his house. It was shut; and as no one answered to my
knocking, I went by back ways and by-lanes to the yard
where he worked. I learned there that he had gone to
Lowestoft, to meet some sudden exigency of ship repairing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
in which his skill was required; but that he would be
back to-morrow morning in good time.</p>

<p>I went back to the inn; and when I had washed
and dressed, and tried to sleep, but in vain, it was five
o'clock in the afternoon. I had not sat five minutes by
the coffee-room fire, when the waiter, coming to stir it as
an excuse for talking, told me that two colliers had gone
down, with all hands, a few miles away; and that some
other ships had been seen laboring hard in the Roads,
and trying in great distress to keep off shore. "Mercy
on them, and on all poor sailors," said he, "if we had
another night like the last!"</p>

<p>I was very much depressed in spirits, very solitary,
and felt an uneasiness in Ham's not being there, disproportionate
to the occasion. I was seriously affected,
without knowing how much, by late events, and my exposure
to the fierce wind had confused me. There was
that jumble in my thoughts and recollections that I had
lost the clear arrangement of time and distance. Thus,
if I had gone out into the town, I should not have been
surprised, I think, to encounter some one who I knew
must be then in London. So to speak, there was in these
respects a curious inattention in my mind. Yet it was
busy, too, with all the remembrances the place naturally
awakened, and they were particularly distinct and vivid.</p>

<p>In this state, the waiter's dismal intelligence about
the ships immediately connected itself, without any effort
of my volition, with my uneasiness about Ham. I was
persuaded that possibly he would attempt to return from
Lowestoft by sea, and be lost. This grew so strong with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
me, that I resolved to go back to the yard before I took
my dinner, and ask the boat builder if he thought his attempting
to return by sea at all likely. If he gave me
the least reason to think so, I would go over to Lowestoft
and prevent it by bringing him with me.</p>

<p>I hastily ordered my dinner, and went back to the
yard. I was none too soon; for the boat builder, with a
lantern in his hand, was locking the yard gate. He quite
laughed when I asked him the question, and said there
was no fear; no man in his senses, or out of them, would
put off in such a gale of wind, least of all Ham Peggotty,
who had been born to seafaring.</p>

<p>I went back to the inn. The howl and roar, the
rattling of the doors and windows, the rumbling in the
chimneys, the apparent rocking of the very house that
sheltered me, and the prodigious tumult of the sea, were
more fearful than in the morning. But there was now a
great darkness besides; and that invested the storm with
new terrors, real and fanciful.</p>

<p>I could not eat, I could not sit still, I could not
continue steadfast in anything. Something within me,
faintly answering to the storm without, tossed up the
depths of my memory and made a tumult in them. Yet,
in all the hurry of my thoughts, wild running with thundering
sea, the storm and my uneasiness regarding Ham
were always in the foreground.</p>

<p>My dinner went away almost untasted, and I tried to
refresh myself with a glass or two of wine. In vain. I
fell into a dull slumber before the fire, without losing my
consciousness either of the uproar out of doors or of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
place in which I was. Both became overshadowed by a
new undefinable horror; and when I awoke&mdash;or rather
when I shook off the lethargy that bound me in my chair&mdash;my
whole frame thrilled with objectless and unintelligible
fear.</p>

<p>I walked to and fro, tried to read an old gazetteer,
listened to the awful noises; looked at faces, scenes, and
figures in the fire. At length the steady ticking of the
undisturbed clock on the wall tormented me to that degree
that I resolved to go to bed.</p>

<p>It was reassuring, on such a night, to be told that some
of the inn servants had agreed together to sit up until
morning. I went to bed, exceedingly weary and heavy;
but on my lying down all such sensations vanished, as if
by magic, and I was broad awake, with every sense refined.</p>

<p>For hours I lay there, listening to the wind and water;
imagining now that I heard shrieks out at sea, now
that I distinctly heard the firing of signal guns, and now
the fall of houses in the town. I got up several times and
looked out, but could see nothing except the reflection in
the window panes of the faint candle I had left burning,
and of my own haggard face looking in at me from the
black void.</p>

<p>At length my restlessness attained to such a pitch,
that I hurried on my clothes, and went downstairs. In
the large kitchen, where I dimly saw bacon and ropes of
onions hanging from the beams, the watchers were clustered
together, in various attitudes, about a table, purposely
moved away from the great chimney, and brought
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
near the door. A pretty girl who had her ears stopped
with her apron, and her eyes upon the door, screamed
when I appeared, supposing me to be a spirit; but the
others had more presence of mind, and were glad of an
addition to their company. One man, referring to the
topic they had been discussing, asked me whether I
thought the souls of the collier crews who had gone down
were out in the storm?</p>

<p>I remained there, I dare say two hours. There was
a dark gloom in my solitary chamber when I at length
returned to it; but I was tired now, and, getting into
bed again, fell off a tower and down a precipice into the
depths of sleep. I have an impression that for a long
time, though I dreamed of being elsewhere and in a
variety of scenes, it was always blowing in my dream.
At length I lost that feeble hold upon reality, and was
engaged with two dear friends, but who they were I don't
know, at the siege of some town in a roar of cannonading.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The thunder of the cannon was so loud and incessant,
that I could not hear something I much desired to
hear, until I made a great exertion, and awoke. It was
broad day&mdash;eight or nine o'clock; the storm raging, in
lieu of the batteries; and some one knocking and calling
at my door.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" I cried.</p>

<p>"A wreck! close by!"</p>

<p>I sprang out of bed, and asked what wreck?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
    "A schooner, from Spain or Portugal, laden with fruit
and wine. Make haste, sir, if you want to see her! Its
thought she'll go to pieces every moment."</p>

<p>The excited voice went clamoring along the staircase;
and I wrapped myself in my clothes as quickly as I could,
and ran into the street. Numbers of people were there
before us, all running in one direction, to the beach. I
ran the same way, outstripping a good many, and soon
came facing the wild sea.</p>

<p>The wind might by this time have lulled a little,
though not more sensibly than if the cannonading I had
dreamed of had been diminished by the silencing of half
a dozen guns out of hundreds. But the sea, having upon
it the additional agitation of the whole night, was infinitely
more terrific than when I had seen it last. Every
appearance it had then presented bore the expression of
being <i>swelled</i>; and the height to which the breakers rose,
and, looking over one another, bore one another down,
and rolled in, in interminable hosts, was most appalling.</p>

<p>In the difficulty of hearing anything but wind and
waves, and in the crowd, and the unspeakable confusion,
and my first breathless attempts to stand against the
weather, I was so confused that I looked out to sea for
the wreck, and saw nothing but the foaming heads of the
great waves. A half-dressed boatman standing next me
pointed with his bare arm (a tattooed arrow on it, pointing
in the same direction) to the left. Then, O great Heaven,
I saw it, close in upon us!</p>

<p>One mast was broken short off, six or eight feet from
the deck, and lay over the side, entangled in a maze
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
of sail and rigging; and all that ruin, as the ship rolled
and beat,&mdash;which she did without a moment's pause, and
with a violence quite inconceivable,&mdash;beat the side as if it
would stave it in. Some efforts were even then being
made to cut this portion of the wreck away; for as the
ship, which was broadside on, turned towards us in her
rolling, I plainly descried her people at work with
axes, especially one active figure, with long curling hair,
conspicuous among the rest. But a great cry, which was
audible even above the wind and water, rose from the
shore at this moment: the sea, sweeping over the rolling
wreck, made a clean breach, and carried men, spars, casks,
planks, bulwarks, heaps of such toys, into the boiling
surge.</p>

<p>The second mast was yet standing, with the rags of
a rent sail, and a wild confusion of broken cordage, flapping
to and fro. The ship had struck once, the same
boatman hoarsely said in my ear, and then lifted in and
struck again. I understood him to add that she was
parting amidships, and I could readily suppose so, for the
rolling and beating were too tremendous for any human
work to suffer long. As he spoke, there was another
great cry of pity from the beach: four men arose with
the wreck out of the deep, clinging to the rigging of the
remaining mast; uppermost, the active figure with the
curling hair.</p>

<p>There was a bell on board; and as the ship rolled
and dashed, like a desperate creature driven mad, now
showing us the whole sweep of her deck, as she turned on
her beam ends towards the shore, now nothing but her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
keel, as she sprung wildly over and turned towards the
sea, the bell rang; and its sound, the knell of those
unhappy men, was borne towards us on the wind. Again
we lost her, and again she rose. Two men were gone.
The agony on shore increased. Men groaned and clasped
their hands; women shrieked, and turned away their faces.
Some ran wildly up and down along the beach, crying for
help where no help could be. I found myself one of these,
frantically imploring a knot of sailors whom I knew, not
to let those two lost creatures perish before our eyes.</p>

<p>They were making out to me, in an agitated way,
that the lifeboat had been bravely manned an hour ago,
and could do nothing; and that as no man would be so
desperate as to attempt to wade off with a rope, and establish
a communication with the shore, there was nothing
left to try; when I noticed that some new sensation moved
the people on the beach, and saw them part, and Ham come
breaking through them to the front.</p>

<p>I ran to him, as well as I know, to repeat my appeal
for help. But distracted though I was by a sight so new
to me and terrible, the determination in his face, and his
look out to sea, awoke me to a knowledge of his danger.
I held him back with both arms, and implored the men
with whom I had been speaking not to listen to him, not
to do murder, not to let him stir from off that sand.</p>

<p>Another cry arose from the shore; and, looking
towards the wreck, we saw the cruel sail, with blow on
blow, beat off the lower of the two men, and fly up in triumph
round the active figure left alone upon the mast.</p>

<p>Against such a sight, and against such determination
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
as that of the calmly desperate man who was already
accustomed to lead half the people present, I might as
hopefully have intreated the wind. "Mas'r Davy," he
said cheerily, grasping me by both hands, "if my time is
come, 'tis come. If't an't, I'll bide it. Lord above bless
you, and bless all! Mates, make me ready! I'm a going
off!"</p>

<p>I was swept away, but not unkindly, to some distance,
where the people around me made me stay; urging, as
I confusedly perceived, that he was bent on going, with
help or without, and that I should endanger the precautions
for his safety by troubling those with whom they
rested. I don't know what I answered, or what they rejoined,
but I saw hurry on the beach, and men running
with ropes from a capstan that was there, and penetrating
into a circle of figures that hid him from me. Then I saw
him standing alone, in a seaman's frock and trowsers, a rope
in his hand or slung to his wrist, another round his body;
and several of the best men holding, at a little distance, to
the latter, which he laid out himself, slack upon the shore,
at his feet.</p>

<p>The wreck, even to my unpracticed eye, was breaking
up. I saw that she was parting in the middle, and that
the life of the solitary man upon the mast hung by a
thread. Still he clung to it.</p>

<p>Ham watched the sea, standing alone, with the silence
of suspended breath behind him, and the storm before,
until there was a great retiring wave, when, with a backward
glance at those who held the rope, which was
made fast round his body, he dashed in after it, and in a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
moment was buffeting with the water&mdash;rising with the
hills, falling with valleys, lost beneath the foam; then
drawn again to land. They hauled in hastily.</p>

<p>He was hurt. I saw blood on his face from where
I stood; but he took no thought of that. He seemed
hurriedly to give them some directions for leaving him
more free, or so I judged from the motion of his arm&mdash;and
was gone, as before.</p>

<p>And now he made for the wreck&mdash;rising with the
hills, falling with the valleys, lost beneath the rugged
foam, borne in towards the shore, borne on towards the
ship, striving hard and valiantly. The distance was
nothing, but the power of the sea and wind made the
strife deadly.</p>

<p>At length he neared the wreck. He was so near
that with one more of his vigorous strokes he would be
clinging to it,&mdash;when a high, green, vast hillside of water,
moving on shoreward from beyond the ship, he seemed to
leap up into it with a mighty bound, and the ship was
gone!</p>

<p>Some eddying fragments I saw in the sea, as if a mere
cask had been broken, in running to the spot where
they were hauling in. Consternation was in every face.
They drew him to my very feet&mdash;insensible, dead. He
was carried to the nearest house; and, no one preventing
me now, I remained near him, busy, while every means of
restoration was tried; but he had been beaten to death
by the great wave, and his generous heart was stilled for
ever.</p>

<h2>THE HAPPY VALLEY.</h2>

<p>The place which the wisdom or policy of antiquity had
destined for the residence of the Abyssinian princes was
a spacious valley in the kingdom of Amhara,
surrounded on every side by mountains,
of which the summits overhang the
middle part. The only passage by
which it could be entered was
a cavern that passed under a
rock, of which it has been long
disputed whether it was the
work of Nature or of human
industry.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
    <a name="p0135-illus.jpg" id="p0135-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p0135-illus.jpg" width="200" height="199" alt="Author's portrait" title="" />
 <p class="caption2">Dr. Samuel Johnson.</p>
</div>
<p>The outlet of the cavern was
concealed by a thick wood, and
the mouth, which opened into
the valley, was closed with gates of iron forged by the
artificers of ancient days, so massy that no man could,
without the help of engines, open or shut them.</p>

<p>From the mountains, on every side, rivulets descended,
that filled all the valley with verdure and fertility, and
formed a lake in the middle, inhabited by fish of every
species, and frequented by every fowl which Nature has
taught to dip the wing in water. This lake discharged
its superfluities by a stream, which entered a dark cleft of
the mountain on the northern side, and fell, with dreadful
noise, from precipice to precipice, till it was heard no
more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
    The sides of the mountains were covered with trees.
The banks of the brooks were diversified with flowers.
Every blast shook spices from the rocks, and every month
dropped fruits upon the ground. All animals that bite
the grass or browse the shrub, whether wild or tame,
wandered in this extensive circuit, secured from beasts of
prey by the mountains which confined them.</p>

<p>On one part were flocks and herds feeding in the pastures;
on another, all the beasts of chase frisking in the
lawns; the sprightly kid was bounding on the rocks, the
subtle monkey frolicking in the trees, and the solemn
elephant reposing in the shade. All the diversities of the
world were brought together; the blessings of nature
were collected, and its evils extracted and excluded.</p>

<p>The valley, wide and fruitful, supplied its inhabitants
with the necessaries of life; and all delights and superfluities
were added at the annual visit which the Emperor
paid his children, when the iron gate was opened to the
sound of music, and during eight days every one that
resided in the valley was required to propose whatever
might contribute to make seclusion pleasant, to fill up the
vacancies of attention, and lessen the tediousness of the
time.</p>

<p>Every desire was immediately granted. All the artificers
of pleasure were called to gladden the festivity; the
musicians exerted the power of harmony, and the dancers
showed their activity before the princes, in hope that they
should pass their lives in this blissful captivity, to which
those only were admitted whose performance was thought
capable of adding novelty to luxury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
    Such was the appearance of security and delight which
this retirement afforded, that they to whom it was
new always desired that it might be perpetual; and as
those on whom the iron gate had once closed were never
suffered to return, the effect of long experience could not
be known. Thus every year produced new schemes of
delight and new competitors for imprisonment.</p>

<p class="cen">*****</p>

<p>Dr. Samuel Johnson's "Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia,"
from which this selection is taken, was first published in
1759. "The late Mr. Strahan, the printer, told me," says
Boswell, "that Johnson wrote it, so that with the profits
he might defray the expenses of his mother's funeral, and
pay some little debts which she had left. He told Sir
Joshua Reynolds that he composed it in the evenings of
one week, sent it to the press in portions as it was written,
and had never since read it over. None of his writings
have been so extensively diffused over Europe, for it has
been translated into most, if not all, of the modern languages.
This tale, with all the charms of oriental imagery,
and all the force and beauty of which the English
language is capable, leads us through the most important
scenes of human life, and shows us that this stage of our
being is full of 'vanity and vexation of spirit.'"</p>

<p>The peculiarities of style which distinguish all of Johnson's
writings are well illustrated in this story. Notice
the stately flow of high-sounding words; the dignified
formality of many of the descriptive passages; and the
richness and perfection which characterize the production
as a whole.</p>

<h2>THE PASS OF KILLIECRANKIE.</h2>

<p>John Græme of Claverhouse, whose title of Viscount
Dundee had been given him in reward for his cruelties to
the Western Covenanters, was the instigator and leader
of a revolt of the Highland clans against the government
of William III. in Scotland. General Mackay, with his
loyal Scotch regiments, was sent out to suppress the uprising.
But as they climbed the pass of Killiecrankie, on
the 27th of July, 1689, Dundee charged them at the head
of three thousand clansmen, and swept them in headlong
rout down the glen. His death in the moment of victory
broke, however, the only bond which held the Highlanders
together, and in a few weeks the host which had
spread terror through the Lowlands melted helplessly
away.</p>

<p>The Græmes, or Grahams, were among the most noted
of Scottish families, and included some of the most distinguished
men of the country. Among them were Sir
John the Græme, the faithful aid of Sir William Wallace,
who fell in the battle of Falkirk, 1298, and the celebrated
Marquis of Montrose, who died in 1650, and whose exploits
are immortalized in Scott's "Legend of Montrose."</p>

<p>In the following stirring verses from "The Lays of
the Scottish Cavaliers," by W. E. Aytoun, the fight at
Killiecrankie is described, presumably, by one of the
adherents of Dundee. The title of the poem in its complete
form is "The Burial March of Dundee." Our selection
includes only so much as relates to the conflict in
the pass.</p>

<span class="i0">Hoarsely roared the swollen torrent,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">From their lair amidst the broom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then we belted on our tartans,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Loudly then the hills reëchoed<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With our answer to his call,<br /></span>

<h2>SUMMER RAIN.</h2>

<p>It is a long time since much rain fell. The ground
is a little dry, the road is a good deal dusty. The garden
bakes. Transplanted trees are thirsty. Wheels are
shrinking and tires are looking dangerous.
Men speculate on the clouds;
they begin to calculate how long it
will be, if no rain falls, before the
potatoes will suffer; the oats, the
grass, the corn&mdash;everything!
To be sure, nothing is yet suffering;
but then&mdash;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">

    <img src="images/p0143-illus.jpg" width="200" height="199" alt="Author's portrait" title="" />
 <p class="caption2">Henry Ward Beecher.</p>
</div>
<p>Rain, rain, rain! All day,
all night, steady raining. Will
it never stop? The hay is out
and spoiling. The rain washes
the garden. All things have
drunk their fill. The springs revive, the meadows are
wet; the rivers run discolored with soil from every
hill.</p>

<p>Smoking cattle reek under the sheds. Hens, and
fowl in general, shelter and plume. The sky is leaden.
The clouds are full yet. The long fleece covers the
mountains. The hills are capped in white. The air
is full of moisture.</p>

<p>The wind roars down the chimney. The birds are
silent. No insects chirp. Closets smell moldy. The
barometer is clogged. We thump it, but it will not get
up. It seems to have an understanding with the weather.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
The trees drip, shoes are muddy, carriage and wagon are
splashed with dirt. Paths are soft.</p>

<p>So it is. When it is clear we want rain, and when it
rains we wish it would shine. But after all, how lucky
for grumblers that they are not allowed to meddle with
the weather, and that it is put above their reach. What
a scrambling, selfish, mischief-making time we should
have, if men undertook to parcel out the seasons and the
weather according to their several humors or interests!</p>

<p>If one will but look for enjoyment, how much there is
in every change of weather. The formation of clouds&mdash;the
various signs and signals, the uncertain wheeling and
marching of the fleecy cohorts, the shades of light and
gray in the broken heavens&mdash;all have their pleasure to
an observant eye. Then come the wind gust, the distant
dark cloud, the occasional fiery streak shot down through
it, the run and hurry of men whose work may suffer!</p>

<p>Indeed, sir, your humble servant, even, was stirred
up on the day after Fourth of July. The grass in the
old orchard was not my best. Indeed, we grumbled at
it considerably while it was yet standing. But being cut
and the rain threatening it, one would have thought it
gold by the nimble way in which we tried to save it!</p>

<p>Blessed be horse rakes! Once, half a dozen men with
half a dozen rakes would have gone whisking up and
down, thrusting out and pulling in the long-handled
rakes with slow and laborious progress. But no more
of that. See friend Turner, mounted on the wheeled
horse rake, riding about as if for pleasure. It is easy
times when <i>men</i> ride and <i>horses</i> rake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
    Meanwhile, the clouds come bowling noiselessly through
the air, and spit here and there a drop preliminary. Well,
if one thing suffers, another gains! See how the leaves
are washed; the grass drinks, even drinks; the garden
drinks; everything drinks.</p>

<p>It is our opinion that everything except man is laughing
and rejoicing. Trees shake their leaves with a softer
sound. Rocks look moist and soft, at least where the
moss grows. Even the solitary old pine tree chords
his harp, and sings soft and low melodies with plaintive
undulations!</p>

<p>A good summer storm is a rain of riches. If gold and
silver rattled down from the clouds, they could hardly
enrich the land so much as soft, long rains. Every drop
is silver going to the mint. The roots are machinery,
and, catching the willing drops, they array them, refine
them, roll them, stamp them, and turn them out coined
berries, apples, grains, and grasses!</p>

<p>When the heavens send clouds and they bank up the
horizon, be sure they have hidden gold in them. All the
mountains of California are not so rich as are the soft
mines of heaven, that send down treasures upon man
without tasking him, and pour riches upon his field without
spade or pickax&mdash;without his search or notice.</p>

<p>Well, let it rain, then! No matter if the journey is

be rain&mdash;and rain in summer. And blessed be he who

<p>It would not be easy to say where or when the first log
cabin was built, but it is safe to say that it was somewhere
in the English colonies of North America, and it
is certain that it became the type
of the settler's house throughout
the whole middle west. It
may be called the American
house, the Western house, the
Ohio house. Hardly any
other house was built for a
hundred years by the men
who were clearing the land
for the stately mansions of
our day. As long as the primeval
forests stood, the log
cabin remained the woodsman's home; and not fifty years
ago, I saw log cabins newly built in one of the richest
and most prosperous regions of Ohio. They were, to be
sure, log cabins of a finer pattern than the first settler
reared. They were of logs handsomely shaped with the
broadax; the joints between the logs were plastered
with mortar; the chimney at the end was of stone; the
roof was shingled, the windows were of glass, and the
door was solid and well hung. But throughout that region
there were many log cabins, mostly sunk to the uses of
stables and corn cribs, of the kind that the borderers built
in the times of the Indian War, from 1750 to 1800. They
were framed of the round logs untouched by the ax except
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
for the notches at the ends where they were fitted into one
another; the chimney was of small sticks stuck together
with mud, and was as frail as a barn swallow's nest; the
walls were stuffed with moss, plastered with clay; the
floor was of rough boards called puncheons, riven from
the block with a heavy knife; the roof was of clapboards
laid loosely on the rafters, and held in place with logs
fastened athwart them.</p>

 <p class="caption2">Log Cabin.</p>
</div>
<p>There is a delightful account of such a log cabin by
John S. Williams, whose father settled in the woods of
Belmont County in 1800. "Our cabin," he says, "had
been raised, covered, part of
the cracks chinked, and part
of the floor laid, when we
moved in on Christmas day.
There had not been a stick
cut except in building the
cabin, which was so high from
the ground that a bear, wolf,
panther, or any animal less
in size than a cow could enter
without even a squeeze....
The green ash puncheons had
shrunk so as to leave cracks in the floor and doors from
one to two inches wide. At both the doors we had high,
unsteady, and sometimes icy steps, made by piling the
logs cut out of the walls, for the doors and the window,
if it could be called a window, when perhaps it was the
largest spot in the top, bottom, or sides of the cabin
where the wind could <i>not</i> enter. It was made by sawing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
out a log, and placing sticks across and then by pasting
an old newspaper over the hole, and applying hog's lard,
we had a kind of glazing which shed a most beautiful
and mellow light across the cabin when the sun shone on
it. All other light entered at the doors, cracks, and
chimneys. Our cabin was twenty-four by eighteen. The
west end was occupied by two beds, the center of each
side by a door.... On the opposite side of the window,
made of clapboards, supported on pins driven into
the walls, were our shelves. On these shelves my sister
displayed in simple order, a host of pewter plates, and
dishes and spoons, scoured and bright.... Our chimney
occupied most of the east end; with pots and kettles
opposite the window, under the shelves, a gun on hooks
over the north door, four split-bottomed chairs, three three-legged
stools, and a small eight by ten looking-glass sloped
from the wall over a large towel and comb case.... We
got a roof laid over head as soon as possible, but it was
laid of loose clapboards split from a red-oak, and a cat
might have shaken every board in our ceiling.... We
made two kinds of furniture. One kind was of hickory
bark, with the outside shaved off. This we would take off
all around the tree, the size of which would determine the
caliber of our box. Into one end we would place a flat
piece of bark or puncheon, cut round to fit in the bark,
which stood on end the same as when on the tree....
A much finer article was made of slippery-elm bark, shaved
smooth, with the inside out, bent round and sewed together,
where the end of the hoop or main bark lapped
over.... This was the finest furniture in a lady's dressing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
room," and such a cabin and its appointments were
splendor and luxury beside those of the very earliest
pioneers, and many of the latest. The Williamses were
Quakers, and the mother was recently from England;
they were of far gentler breeding and finer tastes than
most of their neighbors, who had been backwoodsmen for
generations.</p>

<p>When the first settlers broke the silence of the woods
with the stroke of their axes, and hewed out a space for
their cabins and their fields, they inclosed their homes with
a high stockade of logs, for defense against the Indians;
or if they built their cabins outside the wooden walls of
their stronghold, they always expected to flee to it at the
first alarm, and to stand siege within it.</p>

<p>The Indians had no cannon, and the logs of the stockade
were proof against their rifles; if a breach was made, there
was still the blockhouse left, the citadel of every little fort.
This was heavily built, and pierced with loopholes for the
riflemen within, whose wives ran bullets for them at its
mighty hearth, and who kept the savage foe from its sides
by firing down upon them through the projecting timbers
of its upper story. But in many a fearful siege the Indians
set the roof ablaze with arrows wrapped in burning
tow, and then the fight became desperate indeed. After
the Indian war ended, the stockade was no longer needed,
and the settlers had only the wild beasts to contend with,
and those constant enemies of the poor in all ages and
conditions,&mdash;hunger and cold.</p>

<p>Winter after winter, the Williamses heard the wolves
howling round them in the woods, and this music was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
familiar to the ears of all the Ohio pioneers, who trusted
their rifles for both the safety and support of their families.
They deadened the trees around them by girdling
them with the ax, and planted the spaces between the
leafless trunks with corn and beans and pumpkins. These
were their necessaries, but they had an occasional luxury
in the wild honey from the hollow of a bee tree when the
bears had not got at it.</p>

<p>In its season, there was an abundance of wild fruit,
plums and cherries, haws and grapes, berries, and nuts
of every kind, and the maples yielded all the sugar they
chose to make from them. But it was long before they
had, at any time, the profusion which our modern arts
enable us to enjoy the whole year round, and in the hard
beginnings the orchard and the garden were forgotten
for the fields.</p>

<p>When once the settler was housed against the weather,
he had the conditions of a certain rude comfort indoors.
If his cabin was not proof against the wind and rain or
snow, its vast fireplace formed the means of heating, while
the forest was an inexhaustible store of fuel. At first he
dressed in the skins and pelts of the deer and fox and
wolf, and his costume could have varied little from that
of the red savage about him, for we often read how he
mistook Indians for white men at first sight, and how the
Indians in their turn mistook white men for their own
people.</p>

<p>The whole family went barefoot in the summer, but
in winter the pioneer wore moccasins of buckskin, and
buckskin leggins or trousers; his coat was a hunting
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
shirt belted at the waist and fringed where it fell to his
knees. It was of homespun, a mixture of wool and flax
called linsey-woolsey, and out of this the dresses of his
wife and daughters were made; the wool was shorn from
the sheep which were so scarce that they were never killed
for their flesh, except by the wolves, which were very fond
of mutton, but had no use for wool.</p>

<p>For a wedding dress a cotton check was thought superb,
and it really cost a dollar a yard; silks, satins, laces, were
unknown. A man never left his house without his rifle;
the gun was a part of his dress, and in his belt he carried
a hunting knife and a hatchet; on his head he wore a
cap of squirrel skin, often with the plume-like tail dangling
from it.</p>

<p>The furniture of the cabins was, like the clothing of the
pioneers, homemade. A bedstead was contrived by stretching
poles from forked sticks driven into the ground, and
laying clapboards across them; the bedclothes were bearskins.
Stools, benches, and tables were roughed out with
auger and broadax; the puncheon floor was left bare, and
if the earth formed the floor, no rug ever replaced the
grass which was its first carpet. The cabin had but one
room where the whole of life went on by day; the father
and mother slept there at night, and the children mounted
to their chamber in the loft by means of a ladder.</p>

<p>The food was what has been already named. The meat
was venison, bear, raccoon, wild turkey, wild duck, and
pheasant; the drink was water, or rye coffee, or whisky
which the little stills everywhere supplied only too abundantly.
Wheat bread was long unknown, and corn cakes
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
of various makings and bakings supplied its place. The
most delicious morsel of all was corn grated while still in
the milk and fashioned into round cakes eaten hot from the
clapboard before the fire, or from the mysterious depths
of the Dutch oven, buried in coals and ashes on the hearth.
There was soon a great flow of milk from the kine that
multiplied in the woods and pastures, and there was sweetening
enough from the maple tree and the bee tree, but salt
was very scarce and very dear, and long journeys were made
through the perilous woods to and from the licks, or salt
springs, which the deer had discovered before the white
man or red man knew them.</p>

<p>The bees which hived their honey in the hollow trees
were tame bees gone wild, and with the coming of the
settlers, some of the wild things increased so much that
they became a pest. Such were the crows which literally
blackened the fields after the settlers plowed, and which
the whole family had to fight from the corn when it was
planted. Such were the rabbits, and such, above all,
were the squirrels which overran the farms, and devoured
every green thing till the people combined in great squirrel
hunts and destroyed them by tens of thousands. The
larger game had meanwhile disappeared. The buffalo
and the elk went first; the deer followed, and the bear,
and even the useless wolf. But long after these the
poisonous reptiles lingered, the rattlesnake, the moccasin,
and the yet deadlier copperhead; and it was only when
the whole country was cleared that they ceased to be a
very common danger.</p>

</div>
<p>Charles Reade, in his great romance entitled "The
Cloister and the Hearth," has not only presented us with
a story of absorbing interest, but has given us a vivid
and accurate view of manners and customs
during one of the most interesting
periods of history. The following
extract is particularly
interesting because of its vivid
portrayal of the methods of
warfare in vogue at that time.
There was a rebellion in Flanders.
More than one knight
had broken his oath of fealty
to the Duke of Burgundy, who
was the ruler of that country,
and some of the strongest castles
were fortified by rebels. To subdue these dissatisfied
spirits and to reduce the country again to subjection,
Counts Anthony and Baldwyn of Burgundy had entered
Flanders at the head of a considerable army and were
carrying fire and sword among the enemies of the Duke.
One of their exploits at this time is thus narrated by
the novelist:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>One afternoon they came in sight of a strongly fortified
town; and a whisper went through the little army that
this was a disaffected place. But upon coming nearer
they saw that the great gate stood open, and the towers
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
that flanked it on each side were manned with a single
sentinel apiece. So the advancing force somewhat broke
their array and marched carelessly.</p>

<p>When they were within a furlong, the drawbridge
across the moat rose slowly and creaking till it stood
vertical against the fort; and the very moment it settled,
into this warlike attitude, down rattled the portcullis at
the gate, and the towers and curtains bristled with lances
and crossbows.</p>

<p>A stern hum ran through the front rank and spread to
the rear.</p>

<p>"Halt!" cried their leader. The word went down the
line, and they halted. "Herald to the gate!"</p>

<p>A herald spurred out of the ranks, and halting twenty
yards from the gate, raised his bugle with his herald's
flag hanging down round it, and blew a summons. A tall
figure in brazen armor appeared over the gate. A few
fiery words passed between him and the herald, which
were not audible; but their import was clear, for the
herald blew a single keen and threatening note at the
walls, and came galloping back with war in his face.</p>

<p>The leader moved out of the line to meet him, and their
heads had not been together two seconds ere he turned in
his saddle and shouted, "Pioneers, to the van!" and in a
moment hedges were leveled, and the force took the field
and encamped just out of shot from the walls; and away
went mounted officers flying south, east, and west, to the
friendly towns, for catapults, palisades, mantelets, raw
hides, tar barrels, carpenters, provisions, and all the materials
for a siege.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
    The besiegers encamped a furlong from the walls, and
made roads; kept their pikemen in camp ready for an
assault when practicable; and sent forward their sappers,
pioneers, catapultiers, and crossbowmen. These opened
a siege by filling the moat and mining, or breaching the
wall, etc. And as much of their work had to be done
under close fire of arrows, quarrels, bolts, stones, and little
rocks, the above artists "had need of a hundred eyes,"
and acted in concert with a vigilance, and an amount of
individual intelligence, daring, and skill that made a
siege very interesting, and even amusing,&mdash;to lookers-on.</p>

<p>The first thing they did was to advance their carpenters
behind rolling mantelets, and to erect a stockade high and
strong on the very edge of the moat. Some lives were
lost at this, but not many; for a strong force of crossbowmen,
including Denys, rolled their mantelets<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> up and
shot over the workmen's heads at every besieged person
who showed his nose, and at every loophole, arrow slit, or
other aperture, which commanded the particular spot the
carpenters happened to be upon. Covered by their condensed
fire, these soon raised a high palisade between
them and the ordinary missiles from the walls.</p>

<p>But the besieged expected this, and ran out at night
their hoards or wooden penthouses on the top of the curtains.
The curtains were built with square holes near
the top to receive the beams that supported these structures,
the true defense of mediæval forts, from which the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
besieged delivered their missiles with far more freedom
and variety of range than they could shoot through the
oblique but immovable loopholes of the curtain. On
this the besiegers brought up mangonels, and set them
hurling huge stones at these wood works and battering
them to pieces. At the same time they built a triangular
wooden tower as high as the curtain, and kept it ready
for use, and just out of shot.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
    <a name="p0156-illus.jpg" id="p0156-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p0156-illus.jpg" width="150" height="211" alt="Being besieged" title="" />
 <p class="caption2">Hoard, or Penthouse.</p>
</div>
<p>This was a terrible sight to the besieged. These
wooden towers had taken many a town. They began to
mine underneath that part of the moat the tower
stood frowning at; and made other preparations
to give it a warm reception. The besiegers
also mined, but at another part, their
object being to get under the square barbican
and throw it down. All this
time Denys was behind his mantelet
with another arbalester,
protecting the workmen
and making some excellent
shots. These ended by
earning him the esteem of
an unseen archer, who every
now and then sent a winged
compliment quivering into his mantelet.
One came and stuck within
an inch of the narrow slit through
which Denys was squinting at the
moment.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" cried he, "you shoot well, my friend.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Come forth and receive my congratulations! Shall merit,
such as thine, hide its head? Comrade, it is one of those
Englishmen, with his half ell shaft. I'll not die till I've
had a shot at London wall."</p>

<p>On the side of the besieged was a figure that soon
attracted great notice by promenading under fire. It
was a tall knight, clad in complete brass, and carrying
a light but prodigiously long lance, with which he directed
the movements of the besieged. And when any disaster
befell the besiegers, this tall knight and his long lance
were pretty sure to be concerned in it.</p>

<p>My young reader will say, "Why did not Denys shoot
him?"</p>

<p>Denys did shoot him; every day of his life; other
arbalesters shot him; archers shot him. Everybody
shot him. He was there to be shot, apparently. But
the abomination was, he did not mind being shot. Nay,
worse, he got at last so demoralized as not to seem to
know when he was shot. At last the besiegers got spiteful,
and would not waste any more good steel on him.</p>

<p>It was a bright day, clear, but not quite frosty. The
efforts of the besieging force were concentrated against
a space of about two hundred and fifty yards, containing
two curtains and two towers, one of which was the square
barbican, the other had a pointed roof that was built to
overlap, and by this means a row of dangerous crenelets
between the roof and the masonry grinned down at the
nearer assailants, and looked not very unlike the grinders
of a modern frigate with each port nearly closed. The
curtains were overlapped with penthouses somewhat shattered
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
by the mangonels, and other slinging engines of the
besiegers.</p>

<p>On the besiegers' edge of the moat was what seemed at
first sight a gigantic arsenal, longer than it was broad,
peopled by human ants, and full of busy, honest industry,
and displaying all the various mechanical science of the
age in full operation. Here the lever at work, there the
winch and pulley, here the balance, there the capstan.
Everywhere heaps of stones, and piles of fascines, mantelets,
and rows of fire barrels. Mantelets rolling, the
hammer tapping all day, horses and carts in endless succession
rattling up with materials.</p>

<p>At the edge of the moat opposite the wooden tower, a
strong penthouse, which they called "a cat," might be
seen stealing towards the curtain, and gradually filling
up the moat with fascines and rubbish, which the workmen
flung out at its mouth. It was advanced by two
sets of ropes passing round pulleys, and each worked by
a windlass at some distance from the cat. The knight
burnt the first cat by flinging blazing tar barrels on it. So
the besiegers made the roof of this one very steep, and
covered it with raw hides, and the tar barrels could not
harm it.</p>

<p>And now the engineers proceeded to the unusual step
of slinging fifty-pound stones at an individual.</p>

<p>This catapult was a scientific, simple, and beautiful
engine, and very effective in vertical fire at the short
ranges of the period.</p>

<p>Imagine a fir tree cut down, and set to turn round a
horizontal axis on lofty uprights, but not in equilibrium;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
three fourths of the tree being on the hither side. At
the shorter and thicker end of the tree was fastened a
weight of half a ton. This butt end just before the
discharge pointed towards the enemy. By means of a
powerful winch the long tapering portion of the tree
was forced down to the very ground, and fastened by a
bolt; and the stone placed in a sling attached to the
tree's nose. But this process of course raised the butt
end with its huge weight high in the air, and
kept it there struggling in vain to come down.
The bolt was now drawn; then the short end
swung furiously down,
the long end went as
furiously up, and at its
highest elevation flung
the huge stone out of
the sling with a tremendous
jerk. In this
case the huge mass
so flung missed the
knight, but came down
near him on the penthouse,
and went through it
like paper, making an awful
gap in roof and floor.</p>

 <p class="caption2">A Catapult.</p>
</div>
<p>"Aha! a good shot!"
cried Baldwyn of Burgundy.</p>

<p>The tall knight retired. The besiegers hooted him.
He reappeared on the platform of the barbican, his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
helmet being just visible above the parapet. He seemed
very busy, and soon an enormous Turkish catapult made
its appearance on the platform, and, aided by the elevation
at which it was planted, flung a twenty-pound
stone two hundred and forty yards in the air. The next
stone struck a horse that was bringing up a sheaf of
arrows in a cart, bowled the horse over dead like a rabbit,
and split the cart. It was then turned at the besiegers'
wooden tower, supposed to be out of shot. Sir Turk
slung stones cut with sharp edges on purpose, and struck
it repeatedly, and broke it in several places. The besiegers
turned two of their slinging engines on this
monster, and kept constantly slinging smaller stones
on to the platform of the barbican, and killed two of
the engineers. But the Turk disdained to retort. He
flung a forty-pound stone on to the besiegers' great
catapult, and hitting it in the neighborhood of the axis,
knocked the whole structure to pieces, and sent the
engineers skipping and yelling.</p>

<p>The next morning an unwelcome sight greeted the
besieged. The cat was covered with mattresses and raw
hides, and fast filling up the moat. The knight stoned
it, but in vain; flung burning tar barrels on it, but in
vain. Then with his own hands he let down by a rope
a bag of burning sulphur and pitch, and stunk them out.
But Baldwyn, armed like a lobster, ran, and bounding
on the roof, cut the string, and the work went on. Then
the knight sent fresh engineers into the mine, and undermined
the place and underpinned it with beams, and
covered the beams thickly with grease and tar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
    At break of day the moat was filled, and the wooden
tower began to move on its wheels towards a part of the
curtain on which two catapults were already playing, to
breach the hoards and clear the way. There was something
awful and magical in its approach without visible
agency, for it was driven by internal rollers worked by
leverage.</p>

<p>On the top was a platform, where stood the first assailing
party protected in front by the drawbridge of the
turret, which stood vertical till lowered on to the wall;
but better protected by full suits of armor. The
besieged slung at the tower, and struck it often, but
in vain. It was well defended with mattresses and hides,
and presently was at the edge of the moat. The knight
bade fire the mine underneath it.</p>

<p>Then the Turkish engine flung a stone of half a hundredweight
right amongst the knights, and carried two
away with it off the tower on to the plain.</p>

<p>And now the besieging catapults flung blazing tar
barrels, and fired the hoards on both sides, and the assailants
ran up the ladders behind the tower, and lowered
the drawbridge on to the battered curtain, while the catapults
in concert flung tar barrels, and fired the adjoining
works to dislodge the defenders. The armed men on the
platform sprang on the bridge, led by Baldwyn. The
invulnerable knight and his men at arms met them, and
a fearful combat ensued, in which many a figure was seen
to fall headlong down off the narrow bridge. But fresh
besiegers kept swarming up behind the tower, and the
besieged were driven off the bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
    Another minute, and the town would have been taken;
but so well had the firing of the mines been timed, that
just at this instant the underpinnings gave way, and the
tower suddenly sank away from the walls, tearing the
drawbridge clear and pouring the soldiers off it against
the masonry and on to the dry moat.</p>

<p>The besieged uttered a fierce shout, and in a moment
surrounded Baldwyn and his fellows; but strange to
say, offered them quarter. While a party disarmed and
disposed of these, others fired the turret in fifty places
with a sort of hand grenades. At this work who so
busy as the tall knight? He put fire bags on his long
spear, and thrust them into the doomed structure late
so terrible. To do this, he was obliged to stand on a
projecting beam, holding on by the hand of a pikeman
to steady himself. This provoked Denys; he ran out
from his mantelet, hoping to escape notice in the confusion,
and leveling his crossbow missed the knight clean,
but sent his bolt into the brain of the pikeman, and the
tall knight fell heavily from the wall, lance and all.</p>

<p>The knight, his armor glittering in the morning sun,
fell headlong, but turning as he neared the water, struck
it with a slap that sounded a mile off.</p>

<p>None ever thought to see him again. But he fell at
the edge of the fascines, and his spear stuck into them
under the water, and by a mighty effort he got to the
side, but could not get out. Anthony sent a dozen
knights with a white flag to take him prisoner. He submitted
like a lamb, but said nothing.</p>

<h2>ON A TROPICAL RIVER.</h2>

 <p class="caption2">Charles Kingsley.</p>
</div>
<p>"Westward Ho!" is a novel written by Rev. Charles
Kingsley, and first published in 1855. It is a story of
the times of Queen Elizabeth, of the threatened invasion
of England by the Spanish Armada,
and of wild adventure on the sea and
in the forests of the New World.
Several historical personages are
made to appear in the story, such
as Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir
Francis Drake, Admiral Hawkins,
and others. The hero is
Amyas Leigh, "a Devonshire
youth of great bodily strength,
of lively affection and sweet
temper, combined with a marked
propensity to combat from his
earliest years." Amyas and his companions had undertaken
an expedition to discover the fabled golden city of
Manoa, which was said to exist somewhere in the wilds
of South America. They had been searching more than
three years for this city when they reached the Meta
River in canoes, and the following adventure occurred.</p>

<p class="cen">*****</p>

<p>For three hours or more Amyas Leigh and his companions
paddled easily up the glassy and windless reaches,
between two green flower-bespangled walls of forest, gay
with innumerable birds and insects; while down from
the branches which overhung the stream, long trailers
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
hung to the water's edge, and seemed admiring in the
clear mirror the images of their own gorgeous flowers.
River, trees, flowers, birds, insects,&mdash;it was all a fairyland;
but it was a colossal one; and yet the voyagers
took little note of it.</p>

<p>It was now to them an everyday occurrence to see trees
full two hundred feet high one mass of yellow or purple
blossom to the highest twigs, and every branch and stem
one hanging garden of crimson and orange orchids or
vanillas. Common to them were all the fantastic and
enormous shapes with which Nature bedecks her robes
beneath the fierce suns and fattening rains of the tropic
forest. Common were forms and colors of bird, and fish,
and butterfly, more strange and bright than ever opium
eater dreamed.</p>

<p>The long processions of monkeys, who kept pace with
them along the tree tops, and proclaimed their wonder in
every imaginable whistle and grunt and howl, had ceased
to move their laughter, as much as the roar of the jaguar
and the rustle of the boa had ceased to move their fear;
and when a brilliant green and rose-colored fish, flat-bodied
like a bream, flat-finned like a salmon, and sawtoothed
like a shark, leaped clean on board of the canoe
to escape the rush of a huge alligator (whose loathsome
snout, ere he could stop, actually rattled against the
canoe), Jack coolly picked up the fish and said:</p>

<p>"He's four pound weight! If you catch fish for us
like that, old fellow, just keep in our wake, and we'll
give you the cleanings for your wages!"</p>

<p>They paddled onward hour after hour, sheltering themselves
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
as best they could under the shadow of the southern
bank, while on their right hand the full sun glare lay
upon the enormous wall of mimosas, figs, and laurels,
which formed the northern forest, broken by the slender
shafts of bamboo tufts, and decked with a thousand gaudy
parasites; bank upon bank of gorgeous bloom piled upward
to the sky, till where its outline cut the blue,
flowers and leaves, too lofty to be distinguished by the
eye, formed a broken rainbow of all hues quivering in the
ascending streams of azure mist, until they seemed to
melt and mingle with the very heavens.</p>

<p>And as the sun rose higher and higher, a great stillness
fell upon the forest. The jaguars and the monkeys had
hidden themselves in the darkest depths of the woods.
The birds' notes died out one by one; the very butterflies
ceased their flitting over the tree tops, and slept with outspread
wings upon the glossy leaves, undistinguishable
from the flowers around them. Now and then a parrot
swung and screamed at them from an overhanging bough;
or a thirsty monkey slid lazily down a swinging vine to
the surface of the stream, dipped up the water in his tiny
hand, and started chattering back, as his eyes met those
of some foul alligator peering upward through the clear
depths below.</p>

<p>In shaded nooks beneath the boughs, rabbits as large as
sheep went paddling sleepily round and round, thrusting
up their unwieldy heads among the blooms of the blue
water lilies; while black and purple water hens ran up
and down upon the rafts of floating leaves. The shining
snout of a fresh-water dolphin rose slowly to the surface;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
a jet of spray whirred up; a rainbow hung upon it for a
moment; and the black snout sank lazily again.</p>

<p>Here and there, too, upon some shallow pebbly shore,
scarlet flamingoes stood dreaming knee-deep on one leg;
crested cranes pranced up and down, admiring their own
finery; and irises and egrets dipped their bills under
water in search of prey; but before noon, even those had
slipped away, and there reigned a stillness which might
be heard&mdash;a stillness in which, as Humboldt says: "If
beyond the silence we listen for the faintest undertones,
we detect a stifled, continuous hum of insects, which
crowd the air close to the earth; a confused swarming
murmur which hangs round every bush, in the cracked
bark of trees, in the soil undermined by lizards and bees;
a voice proclaiming to us that all Nature breathes, that
under a thousand different forms life swarms in the gaping
and dusty earth, as much as in the bosom of the waters,
and in the air which breathes around."</p>

<p>At last a soft and distant murmur, increasing gradually
to a heavy roar, announced that they were nearing some
cataract; till, turning a point where the alluvial soil rose
into a low cliff fringed with delicate ferns, they came in
full sight of a scene at which all paused&mdash;not with
astonishment, but with something very like disgust.</p>

<p>"Rapids again!" grumbled one. "I thought we had
had enough of them on the Orinoco!"</p>

<p>"We shall have to get out, and draw the canoes overland,
I suppose!"</p>

<p>"There's worse behind; don't you see the spray behind
the palms?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
    "Stop grumbling, my masters, and don't cry out before
you are hurt. Paddle right up to the largest of those
islands, and let us look about us."</p>

<p>In front of them was a snow-white bar of foam, some
ten feet high, along which were ranged three or four
islands of black rock. Each was crested with a knot of
lofty palms, whose green tops stood out clear against the
bright sky, while the lower half of their stems loomed
hazy through a luminous veil of rainbowed mist. The
banks right and left of the fall were so densely fringed
with a low hedge of shrubs that landing seemed almost
impossible; and their Indian guide, suddenly looking
round him and whispering, bade them beware of savages,
and pointed to a canoe which lay swinging in the eddies
under the largest island, moored apparently to the root of
some tree.</p>

<p>"Silence, all!" cried Amyas, "and paddle up thither
and seize the canoe. If there be an Indian on the island,
we will have speech of him. But mind, and treat him
friendly; and on your lives, neither strike nor shoot, even
if he offers to fight."</p>

<p>So, choosing a line of smooth backwater just in the
wake of the island, they drove their canoes up by main
force, and fastened them safely by the side of the Indian's,
while Amyas, always the foremost, sprang boldly on shore,
whispering to the Indian boy to follow him.</p>

<p>Once on the island, Amyas felt sure enough that, if its
wild tenant had not seen them approach, he certainly had
not heard them, so deafening was the noise which filled
his brain, and which seemed to make the very leaves upon
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the bushes quiver and the solid stone beneath his feet reel
and ring. For two hundred yards and more above the
fall, nothing met his eye but one white waste of raging
foam, with here and there a transverse dike of rock, which
hurled columns of spray and surges of beaded water high
into the air,&mdash;strangely contrasting with the still and
silent cliffs of green leaves which walled the river right
and left, and more strangely still with the knots of enormous
palms upon the islets, which reared their polished
shafts a hundred feet into the air, straight and upright as
masts, while their broad plumes and golden-clustered fruit
slept in the sunshine far aloft, the image of the stateliest
repose amid the wildest wrath of Nature.</p>

<p>Ten yards farther, the cataract fell sheer in thunder;
but a high fern-fringed rock turned its force away from
the beach. Here, if anywhere, was the place to find the
owner of the canoe. He leaped down upon the pebbles;
and as he did so, a figure rose from behind a neighboring
rock, and met him face to face. It was an Indian
girl.</p>

<p>He spoke first, in some Indian tongue, gently and smilingly,
and made a half-step forward; but quick as light
she caught up from the ground a bow, and held it fiercely
toward him, fitted with the long arrow, with which, as he
could see, she had been striking fish, for a line of twisted
grass hung from its barbed head. Amyas stopped, laid
down his own bow and sword, and made another step in
advance, smiling still, and making all Indian signs of
amity. But the arrow was still pointed straight at his
breast, and he knew the mettle and strength of the forest
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
nymphs well enough to stand still and call for the Indian
boy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

    <img src="images/p0171-illus.jpg" width="500" height="380" alt="An encounter" title="" />
 <p class="caption2">A figure rose from behind a neighboring rock.</p>
</div>

<p>The boy, who had been peering from above, leaped down
to them in a moment; and began, as the safest method,
groveling on his nose upon the pebbles, while he tried
two or three dialects, one of which at last she seemed to
understand, and answered in a tone of evident suspicion
and anger.</p>

<p>"What does she say?"</p>

<p>"That you are a Spaniard and a robber because you
have a beard."</p>

<p>"Tell her that we are no Spaniards, but that we hate
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
them, and are come across the great waters to help the
Indians to kill them."</p>

<p>The boy had no sooner spoken, than, nimble as a deer,
the nymph had sprung up the rocks, and darted between
the palm stems to her own canoe. Suddenly she caught
sight of the English boats, and stopped with a cry of fear
and rage.</p>

<p>"Let her pass!" shouted Amyas, who had followed her
closely. "Push your boats off, and let her pass. Boy,
tell her to go on; they will not come near her."</p>

<p>But she hesitated still, and with arrow drawn to the
head, faced first on the boat's crew, and then on Amyas,
till the Englishmen had shoved off full twenty yards.</p>

<p>Then, leaping into her tiny piragua, she darted into
the wildest whirl of the eddies, shooting along with
vigorous strokes, while the English trembled as they saw
the frail bark spinning and leaping amid the muzzles
of the alligators and the huge dog-toothed trout. But,
with the swiftness of an arrow, she reached the northern
bank, drove her canoe among the bushes, and, leaping
from it, darted into the bush, and vanished like a dream.</p>

<p class="cen">*****</p>

<p>The chief interest in the foregoing story lies, of course,
in its faithful and glowing picture of scenery in the midst
of a tropical forest. The learner should read it a second
time and try to point out all the passages that are remarkable
for their wealth of description. He should try to
form in his mind an image of the sights and sounds that
he would encounter in a voyage up the Meta River or any
other of the tributaries of the Orinoco or the Amazon.</p>

<h2>THE FLAG OF OUR COUNTRY.</h2>

<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>I.</h3>

<p>There is the national flag. He must be cold indeed
who can look upon its folds, rippling in the breeze, without
pride of country. If he be in a foreign land, the flag
is companionship and country itself, with all its endearments.</p>

<p>Who, as he sees it, can think of a state merely?
Whose eyes once fastened upon its radiant trophies, can
fail to recognize the image of the whole nation? It has
been called a "floating piece of poetry," and yet I know
not if it have an intrinsic beauty beyond other ensigns.
Its highest beauty is in what it symbolizes. It is because
it represents all, that all gaze at it with delight
and reverence.</p>

<p>It is a piece of bunting lifted in the air; but it speaks
sublimely, and every part has a voice. Its stripes of
alternate red and white proclaim the original union of
thirteen states to maintain the Declaration of Independence.
Its stars of white on a field of blue proclaim that
union of states constituting our national constellation,
which receives a new star with every new state. The two
together signify union past and present.</p>

<p>The very colors have a language which was officially
recognized by our fathers. White is for purity, red for
valor, blue for justice; and altogether, bunting, stripes,
stars, and colors, blazing in the sky, make the flag of our
country to be cherished by all our hearts, to be upheld by
all our hands.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>
<h3>II.</h3>

<p>I have said enough and more than enough to manifest
the spirit in which this flag is now committed to your
charge. It is the national ensign, pure and simple,
dearer to all hearts at this moment as we lift it to the
gale, and see no other sign of hope upon the storm cloud
which rolls and rattles above it, save that which is its
own radiant hues&mdash;dearer, a thousand fold dearer to us
all than ever it was before, while gilded by the sunshine
of prosperity and playing with the zephyrs of peace. It
will speak for itself far more eloquently than I can speak
for it.</p>

<p>Behold it! Listen to it! Every star has a tongue;
every stripe is articulate. There is no speech nor language
where their voices are not heard. There is magic
in the web of it. It has an answer for every question of
duty. It has a solution for every doubt and every perplexity.
It has a word of good cheer for every hour
of gloom or of despondency.</p>

<p>Behold it! Listen to it! It speaks of earlier and of
later struggles. It speaks of victories and sometimes of
reverses, on the sea and on the land. It speaks of patriots
and heroes among the living and among the dead; and of
him, the first and greatest of them all, around whose consecrated
ashes this unnatural and abhorrent strife has
been so long raging. But, before all and above all other
associations and memories,&mdash;whether of glorious men, or
glorious deeds, or glorious places,&mdash;its voice is ever of
Union and Liberty, of the Constitution and of the Laws.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF THOMAS BECKET.</h2>

<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>I. HIS LIFE.</h3>

<p>Henry II. began his reign over England in the year
1154, and he was the mightiest king that had yet sat
upon the throne. He had vast possessions. All England
and nearly half of France were his, and he was well able
to rule over them and keep them in order.</p>

<p>He was a short, stout, reddish-haired man, with a face
well-tanned by exposure to the wind and the sun. His
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
legs were bowed by constant riding. Ever busy at something,
he rarely sat down, except at meals; and there
was plenty of work for him to do.</p>

<p>In the early years of his reign his chief friend and
servant was Thomas Becket, who was a clever and handsome
man. He knew well how to please the king by
sharing in his amusements, and by helping him in the great
work of keeping order among his barons and knights.</p>

<p>When Becket was a young man he was out hunting,
one day, with his pet hawk upon his wrist. Riding carelessly
along, he came to a narrow wooden bridge, which
crossed a stream close to a mill. When in the middle
of the bridge his horse stumbled, and Becket, horse,
and hawk were thrown into the water.</p>

<p>The horse at once swam to the bank. So did Becket,
but, upon looking back, he saw his hawk struggling in
the middle of the stream. Its straps had become entangled
about its feet and wings, and the bird was helpless.
Although the stream was running swiftly to the
great mill-wheel, Becket turned round and swam back
to save the hawk.</p>

<p>By this time the current had carried him very near to
the wheel, and in another moment both man and bird must
have been crushed to death. But just then the miller saw
the danger and stopped the mill. Becket climbed out of
the water with the bird in his hand, seeming not at all
frightened because of the danger which he had escaped.
During his entire life he had many trials and was opposed
by many enemies; but he faced them all as fearlessly as
he had risked drowning in order to save his hawk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
    King Henry made Becket his chancellor, that is his chief
minister, and gave him much wealth. Becket lived in
great splendor in a fine palace. He was so hospitable
that he kept an open table, at which all were free to
come and feast when they chose. His clothes were the
finest and gayest that could be made, and wherever he
went he took with him troops of friends and servants.</p>

<p>Once, when he was sent to France to settle a dispute
with the French king, he traveled with such a large
train of followers that the people were filled with wonder.
We can picture the procession entering a quiet
country town.</p>

<p>"First came two hundred boys singing quaint songs or
glees. Then followed great hounds with their keepers,
behind whom were wagons guarded by fierce English
mastiffs. One of the wagons was laden with beer to be
given away to the people who might render any help
on the road.</p>

<p>"Then came twelve horses, upon each of which sat a
monkey and a groom. After all these there followed a
vast company of knights and squires and priests, riding
two and two.</p>

<p>"Last of all came Becket and a few friends, with whom
he talked by the way." We can imagine the wonder of
the French people at so fine, yet strange, a show. We
can hear them exclaim, "What kind of a man must the
king of England be, when his chancellor can travel in
such state!"</p>

<p>At this time the Church in England possessed great
power and wealth. It was the safeguard that stood
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
between the people and the greed and cruelty of their
rulers. It was the protector of the poor, and the friend
of the oppressed; and even the king was obliged to obey
its commands.</p>

 <p class="caption2">Thomas Becket.<br />(From an Old Painting.)</p>
</div>
<p>King Henry was jealous of the influence of the Church.
He resolved that, having already reduced the power of
the barons, he would now reduce the
power of the Church. And among
all his faithful men, who would be
more likely to help him in such
business than his friend Becket,
who had hitherto been his
ablest assistant in every undertaking?</p>

<p>It happened about this time
that the Archbishop of Canterbury,
the highest officer of
the Church in England, died.
This event was very pleasing
to Henry, and through his
influence the Pope appointed Thomas Becket to be the
new archbishop.</p>

<p>Becket had hitherto been faithful to Henry in all
things, but he now felt that his first duty was to the
Church, and he resolved to defend its rights, even though
he should displease the king. He changed entirely the
manner of his life. Instead of his splendid clothes, he
wore a monk's dress and a hair shirt next to his skin.
He tried, as people understood it in those times, to carry
out the teachings of his Lord and Master; and every day
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
he waited upon a number of poor men and washed their
feet. Instead of gay knights only good and pious men
sat at his table. He gave up his chancellorship, and told
the king plainly that he would resist all attempts to take
away the rights of the Church.</p>

<p>Many were the quarrels after that between the king
and the archbishop. At one time, in a fit of rage, Henry
cried out: "I will not be preached at by you. Are you
not the son of one of my clowns?"</p>

<p>"It is true," replied the archbishop, "I am not descended
from ancient kings, but neither was the blessed
Peter to whom were given the keys of the kingdom of
heaven."</p>

<p>"But Peter," said the king, "died for his Lord."</p>

<p>"And I, too, will die for my Lord," said Becket, "when
the time shall come."</p>

<p>And it was not long till the time did come. Upon
hearing some hasty, angry words from the king, four
knights set out to Canterbury, determined to kill Becket,
and thus not only put an end to the long quarrel but win
the king's favor for themselves.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>II. HIS DEATH.</h3>

<p>The vespers had already begun, and the monks were
singing the service in the choir, when two boys rushed
up the nave, announcing, more by their terrified gestures
than by their words, that the soldiers were bursting into
the palace and monastery. Instantly the service was
thrown into the utmost confusion; part remained at
prayer, part fled into the numerous hiding places the vast
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
fabric affords; and part went down the steps of the choir
into the transept to meet the little band at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in, come in!" exclaimed one of them. "Come
in, and let us die together."</p>

<p>The Archbishop continued to stand outside, and said:
"Go and finish the service. So long as you keep in
the entrance, I shall not come in." They fell back a
few paces, and he stepped within the door, but, finding
the whole place thronged with people, he paused on the
threshold, and asked, "What is it that these people
fear?" One general answer broke forth, "The armed
men in the cloister." As he turned and said, "I shall
go out to them," he heard the clash of arms behind. The
knights had just forced their way into the cloister, and
were now (as would appear from their being thus seen
through the open door) advancing along its southern
side. They were in mail, which covered their faces up
to their eyes, and carried their swords drawn. Three
had hatchets. Fitzurse, with the ax he had taken from
the carpenters, was foremost, shouting as he came, "Here,
here, king's men!" Immediately behind him followed
Robert Fitzranulph, with three other knights; and a
motley group&mdash;some their own followers, some from the
town&mdash;with weapons, though not in armor, brought up
the rear. At this sight, so unwonted in the peaceful
cloisters of Canterbury, not probably beheld since the
time when the monastery had been sacked by the Danes,
the monks within, regardless of all remonstrances, shut
the door of the cathedral, and proceeded to barricade it
with iron bars. A loud knocking was heard from the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 187]<br />[Pg 188]</a></span>
band without, who, having vainly endeavored to prevent
the entrance of the knights into the cloister, now rushed
before them to take refuge in the church. Becket, who
had stepped some paces into the cathedral, but was resisting
the solicitations of those immediately about him to
move up into the choir for safety, darted back, calling
aloud as he went, "Away, you cowards! By virtue of
your obedience I command you not to shut the door&mdash;the
church must not be turned into a castle." With his
own hands he thrust them away from the door, opened
it himself, and catching hold of the excluded monks,
dragged them into the building, exclaiming, "Come in,
come in&mdash;faster, faster!"</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
    <a name="p0187-illus.jpg" id="p0187-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p0187-illus.jpg" width="500" height="297" alt="A very large church" title="" />
 <p class="caption2">From a Photograph.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engraved by Charles Meeder.<br />
                     Canterbury Cathedral.</p>
</div>

<p>The knights, who had been checked for a moment by
the sight of the closed door, on seeing it unexpectedly
thrown open, rushed into the church. It was, we must
remember, about five o'clock in a winter evening; the
shades of night were gathering, and were deepened into a
still darker gloom within the high and massive walls of
the vast cathedral, which was only illuminated here and
there by the solitary lamps burning before the altars.
The twilight, lengthening from the shortest day a fortnight
before, was but just sufficient to reveal the outline
of objects.</p>

<p>In the dim twilight they could just discern a group of
figures mounting the steps of the eastern staircase. One
of the knights called out to them, "Stay." Another,
"Where is Thomas Becket, traitor to the king?" No
answer was returned. None could have been expected by
any one who remembered the indignant silence with which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Becket had swept by when the same words had been
applied by Randulf of Broc at Northampton. Fitzurse
rushed forward, and, stumbling against one of the monks
on the lower step, still not able to distinguish clearly in
the darkness, exclaimed, "Where is the Archbishop?"
Instantly the answer came: "Reginald, here I am, no
traitor, but the archbishop and priest of God; what do
you wish?" and from the fourth step, which he had
reached in his ascent, with a slight motion of his head&mdash;noticed
apparently as his peculiar manner in moments of
excitement&mdash;Becket descended to the transept. Attired,
we are told, in his white rochet, with a cloak and hood
thrown over his shoulders, he thus suddenly confronted
his assailants. Fitzurse sprang back two or three paces,
and Becket passing by him took up his station between the
central pillar and the massive wall which still forms the
southwest corner of what was then the chapel of St.
Benedict. Here they gathered round him, with the cry,
"Absolve the bishops whom you have excommunicated."
"I cannot do other than I have done," he replied, and
turning to Fitzurse, he added, "Reginald, you have received
many favors at my hands; why do you come into
my church armed?" Fitzurse planted the ax against his
breast, and returned for answer, "You shall die&mdash;I will
tear out your heart." Another, perhaps in kindness,
struck him between the shoulders with the flat of his
sword, exclaiming, "Fly; you are a dead man." "I am
ready to die," replied the primate, "for God and the
Church; but I warn you, I curse you in the name of God
Almighty, if you do not let my men escape."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
    The well-known horror which in that age was felt at
an act of sacrilege, together with the sight of the crowds
who were rushing in from the town through the nave,
turned their efforts for the next few moments to carrying
him out of the church. Fitzurse threw down the ax,
and tried to drag him out by the collar of his long cloak,
calling, "Come with us&mdash;you are our prisoner." "I
will not fly, you detestable fellow," was Becket's reply,
roused to his usual vehemence, and wrenching the cloak
out of Fitzurse's grasp. The three knights struggled
violently to put him on Tracy's shoulders. Becket set
his back against the pillar, and resisted with all his might,
whilst Grim, vehemently remonstrating, threw his arms
around him to aid his efforts. In the scuffle, Becket
fastened upon Tracy, shook him by his coat of mail, and
exerting his great strength flung him down on the pavement.
It was hopeless to carry on the attempt to remove
him. And in the final struggle which now began, Fitzurse,
as before, took the lead. He approached with his
drawn sword, and waving it over his head, cried, "Strike,
strike!" but merely dashed off his cap. Tracy sprang
forward and struck a more decided blow.</p>

<p>The blood from the first blow was trickling down his
face in a thin streak; he wiped it with his arm, and when
he saw the stain, he said, "Into thy hands, O Lord, I
commend my spirit." At the third blow, he sank on his
knees&mdash;his arms falling, but his hands still joined as if in
prayer. With his face turned towards the altar of St.
Benedict, he murmured in a low voice, "For the name of
Jesus, and the defense of the Church, I am willing to die."
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Without moving hand or foot, he fell flat on his face as
he spoke. In this posture he received a tremendous blow,
aimed with such violence that the scalp or crown of the
head was severed from the skull. "Let us go&mdash;let us
go," said Hugh of Horsea, "the traitor is dead; he will
rise no more."</p>

<p>The life of Thomas Becket, and his tragic death, have
furnished themes for many noble contributions to English
literature. Arthur Penrhyn Stanley,
Dean of Westminster, has written of
him, in a very impartial and trustworthy
manner, in his "Historical
Memoirs of Canterbury"
from which the above extract
is taken. The poet Tennyson,
late in life, composed a tragedy
entitled "Becket" which portrays
in a vivid, poetical manner
the most striking scenes in
the career of the great archbishop.
James Anthony Froude,
in "Short Stories on Great Subjects," has written a charming
and instructive essay on the "Life and Times of
Thomas Becket"; and Professor Freeman has presented
us with a similar historical study in his "Saint Thomas
of Canterbury." It may also be observed that Chaucer's
immortal work, "The Canterbury Tales," depends for its
connecting thread upon the once general custom of making
pilgrimages to the tomb of Becket.</p>

the tedious voyage. Suns rise and set, and weeks
and months pass, and winter surprises them on the deep,
but brings them not the sight of the
wished-for shore. I see them now,
scantily supplied with provisions,
crowded almost to suffocation, in their
ill-stored prison, delayed by calms,
pursuing a circuitous route,&mdash;and
now, driven in fury
before the raging tempest,
on the high and giddy
waves. The awful voice of
the storm brawls through
the rigging.</p>

<p>The laboring masts seem
straining from their base; the dismal sound of the pumps
is heard; the ship leaps, as it were, madly, from billow to
billow; the ocean breaks, and settles with engulfing floods
over the floating deck, and beats with deadening, shivering
weight, against the staggering vessel.</p>

<p>I see them escape from these perils, pursuing their all
but desperate undertaking, and landed at last, after a five
months' passage, on the ice-clad rocks of Plymouth,&mdash;weak
and weary from the voyage, poorly armed, scantily
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
provisioned, without shelter, without means, surrounded
by hostile tribes.</p>

<p>Shut now the volume of history, and tell me, on any
principle of human probability, what shall be the fate of
this handful of adventurers? Tell me, man of military
science, in how many months were they all swept off by
the thirty savage tribes, enumerated within the early
limits of New England?</p>

<p>Tell me, politician, how long did a shadow of a colony
on which your conventions and treaties had not smiled,
languish on the distant coast? Student of history, compare
for me the baffled projects, the deserted settlements,
the abandoned adventures of other times, and find the
parallel of this.</p>

<p>Was it the winter's storm, beating upon the houseless
heads of women and children? was it hard labor and
spare meals? was it disease? was it the tomahawk? was
it the deep malady of a blighted hope, a ruined enterprise,
and a broken heart, aching in its last moments at the
recollection of the loved and left, beyond the sea? was it
some, or all of these united, that hurried this forsaken
company to their melancholy fate?</p>

<p>And is it possible, that neither of these causes, that not
all combined, were able to blast this bud of hope? Is it
possible, that from a beginning so feeble, so frail, so worthy
not so much of admiration as of pity, there has gone
forth a progress so steady, a growth so wonderful, an expansion
so ample, a reality so important, a promise, yet to
be fulfilled, so glorious?</p>

<h2>THE ROBIN.</h2>

<p>The robin is perhaps the best known of all our birds.
The name is so prominent in children's stories, in folklore,
in poetry, and in general literature, that even town
children who have never seen the bird know it by name;
but to many grown people, even those who have lived all
their lives in the country, the robin is not familiar as a
winter bird. It is known to come and go, it is true, but
is supposed to be merely in transit, and just where the
observer happens to be is not its abiding place. This
impression is due to lack of observation, for the birds are
as well disposed towards your thicket and cedar trees as
those of some far-off neighbor.</p>

<p>This crystal-clear, cold January day, with the mercury
almost at zero, I found the robins on the south hillside,
and seldom have they shown to better advantage. One
was perched in a sapling beech to which the leaves still
clung. It chirped at times so that its companions could
hear it, and was answered by them, as well as by the nuthatches,
a tree creeper, some sparrows, and a winter wren.</p>

<p>It was a cozy, warm spot wherein these birds had
gathered, which, strangely enough, was filled with music
even when every bird was mute. This robin was half
concealed among the crisp beech leaves, and these&mdash;not
the birds about them&mdash;were singing. The breeze caused
them to tremble violently, and their thin edges were as
harp strings, the wiry sound produced being smoothed by
the crisp rattling caused by the leaves' rapid contact with
each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
    It was much like the click of butterflies' wings, but
greatly exaggerated. A simple sound, but a sweet,
wholesome one that made me think less of the winter's
rigor and recalled the recent warm autumnal days. They
were singing leaves, and the robin watched them closely
as he stood near by, and chirped at times, as if to encourage
them. Altogether it made a pretty picture, one of
those that human skill has not yet transferred to a printed
page; and our winter sunshine is full of just such beauty.</p>

<p>How incomprehensible it is that any one should speak
of the <i>few</i> robins that venture to remain! Flocks of a
hundred or more are not uncommon in the depth of
winter, and this recalls the fact that at this time of year
robins are never alone. It may appear so for a time, but
when the bird you are watching is ready to move on, his
call will be answered by others that you have not seen,
and half a dozen at least will fly off to new scenes.</p>

<p>This is often noticed on a much larger scale when we
flush robins in a field. They are generally widely scattered,
and, go where you will, there will be one or two
hopping before you; but when one takes alarm, the
danger cry is heard by all, and a great flock will gather
in the air in an incredibly short time.</p>

<p>Robins are not lovers of frozen ground; they know
where the earth resists frost, down in the marshy meadows,
and there they congregate in the dreary midwinter afternoons,
after spending the morning feeding upon berries.
I have seen them picking those of the cedar, poison ivy,
green brier, and even the seedy, withered fruit of the
poke; but at times this question of food supply must
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
be a difficult problem to solve, and then they leave us
for a while, until pleasanter weather prevails, when they
venture back.</p>

<p>In April, when the chill of winter is no longer in its
bones, the robin becomes prominent, and the more so
because of the noise it makes. It sings fairly well, and
early in the morning there is a world of suggestiveness
in the ringing notes. The song is loud, declamatory, and
acceptable more for the pleasant thoughts it occasions
than for the actual melody. We are always glad to hear
the robins, but never for the same reason that we listen
to a wood thrush. Of course there are exceptions.</p>

<p>With the close of the nesting season&mdash;and this extends
well into the summer&mdash;much of the attractiveness
of the bird disappears. As individual members of great
loose flocks that fret the upper air with an incessant
chirping, they offer little to entertain us even when the
less hardy minstrels of the summer have sought their
southern homes.</p>

<p>It is true that they add something to the picture of a
dreamy October afternoon when the mellow sunlight tips
the wilted grasses with dull gold. They restore for the
time the summertide activity of the meadows when with
golden-winged woodpeckers they chase the crickets in the
close-cropped pastures, but they are soon forgotten if a
song sparrow sings or a wary hawk screams among the
clouds. Robins are always welcome, but never more so
than when they chatter, on an April morning, of the near
future with its buds and blossoms.</p>

<h2>THE MOTIONS OF BIRDS.</h2>

<p>A good ornithologist should be able to distinguish birds
by their air as well as by their colors and shape, on the
wing as well as on the ground; and in the bush as well
as in the hand. For though it must not be said that
every species of bird has a manner peculiar to itself, yet
there is somewhat in most <i>genera</i>, at least, that at first
sight discriminates them, and enables a judicious observer
to pronounce upon them with some certainty.</p>

<p>Thus kites and buzzards sail round in circles with
wings expanded and motionless; and it is from their gliding
manner that the former are still called in the north of
England gleads, from the Saxon verb <i>glidan</i>, to glide.
Hen harriers fly low over the meadows or fields of corn,
and beat the ground regularly like a pointer or setting
dog. Owls move in a buoyant manner, as if lighter than
the air; they seem to want ballast.</p>

<p>There is a peculiarity belonging to ravens that must
draw the attention even of the most incurious&mdash;they
spend all their leisure time in striking and cuffing each
other on the wing in a kind of playful skirmish; and,
when they move from one place to another, frequently
turn on their backs with a loud croak, and seem to be
falling to the ground. When this odd gesture betides
them, they are scratching themselves with one foot, and
thus lose the center of gravity. Rooks sometimes dive
and tumble in a frolicsome manner; crows and daws
swagger in their walk; woodpeckers fly with a wavy
motion, opening and closing their wings at every stroke,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
and so are always rising or falling in curves. All of this
genus use their tails, which incline downward, as a support
while they run up trees. Parrots, like all other
hooked-clawed birds, walk awkwardly, and make use of
their bill as a third foot, climbing and descending with
ridiculous caution.</p>

<p>All the gallinæ parade and walk gracefully, and run
nimbly, but fly with difficulty, with an impetuous whirring,
and in a straight line. Magpies and jays flutter
with powerless wings, and make no dispatch; herons
seem encumbered with too much sail for their light
bodies, but these vast hollow wings are necessary in
carrying burdens, such as large fishes, and the like;
pigeons, and particularly the sort called smiters, have a
way of clashing their wings, the one against the other,
over their backs with a loud snap; another variety, called
tumblers, turn themselves over in the air.</p>

<p>The kingfisher darts along like an arrow; fern owls,
or goatsuckers, glance in the dusk over the tops of trees
like a meteor; swallows sweep over the surface of the
ground and water, and distinguish themselves by rapid
turns and quick evolutions; swifts dash round in circles;
and the bank martin moves with frequent vacillations like
a butterfly.</p>

<p>Most small birds hop; but wagtails and larks walk, moving
their legs alternately. All the duck kind waddle;
divers and auks walk as if fettered, and stand erect, on
their tails. Geese and cranes, and most wild fowls, move
in figured flights, often changing their position.</p>

<h2>THE ORIGIN OF RIVERS.</h2>

<p>Let us trace a river to its source. Beginning where it
empties itself into the sea, and following it backwards,
we find it from time to time joined by tributaries which
swell its waters. The river of course becomes smaller as
these tributaries are passed. It shrinks first to a brook,
then to a stream; this again divides
itself into a number of smaller streamlets,
ending in mere threads of water.
These constitute the source of
the river, and are usually found
among hills.</p>

 <p class="caption2">John Tyndall.</p>
</div>
<p>Thus, the Severn has its source
in the Welsh mountains; the
Thames in the Cotswold Hills;
the Missouri in the Rocky Mountains;
and the Amazon in the
Andes of Peru.</p>

<p>But it is quite plain that we have
not yet reached the real beginning
of the rivers. Whence do the earliest streams derive
their water? A brief residence among the mountains
would prove to you that they are fed by rains. In dry
weather you would find the streams feeble, sometimes,
indeed, quite dried up. In wet weather you would see
them foaming torrents. In general these streams lose
themselves as little threads of water upon the hillsides;
but sometimes you may trace a river to a definite spring.
But you very soon assure yourself that such springs are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
also fed by rain, which has percolated through the rocks
or soil, and which, through some orifice that it has found
or formed, comes to the light of day.</p>

<p>But we can not end here. Whence comes the rain that
forms the mountain streams? Observation enables you
to answer the question. Rain does not come from a clear
sky. It comes from clouds.</p>

<p>But what are clouds? Is there nothing you are acquainted
with which they resemble? You discover at
once a likeness between them and the condensed steam
of a locomotive. At every puff of the engine a cloud is
projected into the air.</p>

<p>Watch the cloud sharply. You notice that it first
forms at a little distance from the top of the funnel.
Give close attention and you will sometimes see a perfectly
clear space between the funnel and the cloud.
Through that clear space the thing which makes the
cloud must pass. What then is this thing which at one
moment is transparent and invisible, and at the next
moment visible as a dense opaque cloud?</p>

<p>It is the <i>steam</i> or <i>vapor of water</i> from the boiler.
Within the boiler this steam is transparent and invisible;
but to keep it in this invisible state a heat would be
required as great as that within the boiler. When the
vapor mingles with the cold air above the hot funnel, it
ceases to be vapor. Every bit of steam shrinks, when
chilled, to a much more minute particle of water. The
liquid particles thus produced form a kind of <i>water dust</i>
of exceeding fineness, which floats in the air, and is called
a <i>cloud</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
    Watch the cloud banner from the funnel of a running
locomotive: you see it growing gradually less dense. It
finally melts away altogether, and, if you continue your
observations, you will not fail to notice that the speed of
its disappearance depends on the character of the day.
In moist weather the cloud hangs long and lazily in the
air; in dry weather it is rapidly licked up. What has
become of it? It has been reconverted into true invisible
vapor. The <i>drier</i> the air, and the <i>hotter</i> the air, the
greater is the amount of cloud which can be thus dissolved
in it.</p>

<p>Make the lid of a kettle air-tight, and permit the steam
to issue from the spout; a cloud is formed in all respects
similar to that which issues from the funnel of the locomotive.
To produce the cloud, in the case of the locomotive
and the kettle, <i>heat</i> is necessary. By heating the
water we first convert it into steam, and then by chilling
the steam we convert it into cloud. Is there any fire in
nature which produces the clouds of our atmosphere?
There is&mdash;the fire of the sun.</p>

<p>By tracing the course of a river, we find that both
its beginning and its ending are in the sea. All its water
is derived from the sea, and to the sea it returns its
floods. But if we seek for its causes, we find that its
beginning and its ending are in the sun. For it is the
fire of the sun that produces the clouds from which the
water of the river is derived, and it is the same fire of
the sun that dries up its stream.</p>

</div>
<p>Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought
forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty,
and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created
equal. Now we are engaged in a
great civil war, testing whether that
nation, or any nation so conceived
and so dedicated, can long endure.
We are met on a great
battlefield of the war. We
have come to dedicate a portion
of that field as a final
resting place for those who
here gave their lives that
their nation might live. It
is altogether fitting and proper
that we should do this.</p>

<p>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not
consecrate, we can not hallow this ground. The brave
men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated
it far above our power to add or detract. The world
will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but
it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the
living, rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work
which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the
great task remaining before us&mdash;that from these honored
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which
they gave the last full measure of devotion&mdash;that we here
highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain&mdash;that
this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of
freedom&mdash;and that government of the people, by the people,
for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>

<h2>THE LAST FIGHT IN THE COLISEUM,<br />
A.D. 404.</h2>

<p>The grandest and most renowned of all ancient amphitheaters
is the Coliseum at Rome. It was built by
Vespasian and his son Titus, the conquerors of Jerusalem,
in a valley in the midst of the seven
hills of Rome. The captive Jews
were forced to labor at it; and the
materials&mdash;granite outside, and a
softer stone within&mdash;are so
solid, and so admirably put
together, that still, at the end
of eighteen centuries, it has
scarcely even become a ruin,
but remains one of the greatest
wonders of Rome. Five acres of
ground were inclosed within the
oval of its outer wall, which outside
rises perpendicularly in tiers of arches one above another.
Within, the galleries of seats projected forwards, each
tier coming out far beyond the one above it; so that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
between the lowest and the outer wall there was room
for a great variety of chambers, passages, and vaults
around the central space, called the arena.</p>

<p>Altogether, when full, this huge building held no fewer
than 87,000 spectators! It had no roof; but when there
was rain, or if the sun was too hot, the sailors in the
porticoes unfurled awnings that ran along upon ropes, and
formed a covering of silk and gold tissue over the whole.
Purple was the favorite color for this veil, because,
when the sun shone through it, it cast such beautiful rosy
tints on the snowy arena and the white purple-edged togas
of the Roman citizens.</p>

<p>When the emperor had seated himself and given the
signal, the sports began. Sometimes a rope dancing elephant
would begin the entertainment, by mounting even
to the summit of the building and descending by a cord.
Or a lion came forth with a jeweled crown on his head, a
diamond necklace round his neck, his mane plaited with
gold, and his claws gilded, and played a hundred pretty
gentle antics with a little hare that danced fearlessly
within his grasp.</p>

<p>Sometimes water was let into the arena, a ship sailed
in, and falling to pieces in the midst, sent a crowd of
strange animals swimming in all directions. Sometimes
the ground opened, and trees came growing up through
it, bearing golden fruit. Or the beautiful old tale of
Orpheus was acted: these trees would follow the harp
and song of a musician; but&mdash;to make the whole part
complete&mdash;it was no mere play, but in real earnest, that
the Orpheus of the piece fell a prey to live bears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
    For the Coliseum had not been built for such harmless
spectacles as those first described. The fierce Romans
wanted to be excited and to feel themselves strongly
stirred; and, presently, the doors of the pits and dens
around the arena were thrown open, and absolutely savage
beasts were let loose upon one another&mdash;rhinoceroses
and tigers, bulls and lions, leopards and wild boars&mdash;while
the people watched with ferocious curiosity to see
the various kinds of attack and defense, their ears at the
same time being delighted, instead of horror-struck, by
the roars and howls of the noble creatures whose
courage was thus misused.</p>

 <p class="caption2">The Coliseum at the Present Day.</p>
</div>
<p>Wild beasts tearing each
other to pieces might, one
would think, satisfy any
taste for horror; but the
spectators needed even
nobler game to be set
before their favorite monsters:&mdash;men
were brought
forward to confront them. Some of these were, at first,
in full armor, and fought hard, generally with success.
Or hunters came, almost unarmed, and gained the victory
by swiftness and dexterity, throwing a piece of cloth
over a lion's head, or disconcerting him by putting their
fist down his throat. But it was not only skill, but
death, that the Romans loved to see; and condemned
criminals and deserters were reserved to feast the lions,
and to entertain the populace with their various kinds of
death. Among those condemned was many a Christian
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]<br />[Pg 212]</a></span>
martyr, who witnessed a good confession before the savage-eyed
multitude around the arena, and "met the lion's gory
mane" with a calm resolution and a hopeful joy that the
lookers-on could not understand. To see a Christian die,
with upward gaze, and hymns of joy on his tongue, was
the most strange and unaccountable sight the Coliseum
could offer; and it was therefore the choicest, and reserved
for the last of the spectacles in which the brute creation
had a part.</p>

<p>The carcasses were dragged off with hooks, the bloodstained
sand was covered with a fresh green layer, perfume
was wafted in stronger clouds, and a procession
come forward&mdash;tall, well-made men, in the prime of their
strength. Some carried a sword and a lasso, others a
trident and a net; some were in light armor, others in
the full, heavy equipment of a soldier; some on horseback,
some in chariots, some on foot. They marched in,
and made their obeisance to the emperor; and with one
voice their greeting sounded through the building: "Hail,
Cæsar; those about to die salute thee!" They were the
gladiators&mdash;the swordsmen trained to fight to the death
to amuse the populace.</p>

                     The Last Prayer&mdash;Christian Martyrs in the Coliseum.</p>
</div>

<p>Fights of all sorts took place,&mdash;the light-armed soldier
and the netsman&mdash;the lasso and the javelin&mdash;the two
heavy-armed warriors,&mdash;all combinations of single combat,
and sometimes a general mêlée. When a gladiator
wounded his adversary, he shouted to the spectators, "He
has it!" and looked up to know whether he should kill
or spare. When the people held up their thumbs, the
conquered was left to recover, if he could; if they turned
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
them down, he was to die; and if he showed any reluctance
to present his throat for the deathblow, there was a scornful
shout, "Receive the steel!"</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"I see before me the gladiator lie:<br /></span>
<span class="i3">He leans upon his hand; his manly brow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Consents to death, but conquers agony;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And his drooped head sinks gradually low;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the red gash, fall heavy, one by one,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Like the first of a thunder-shower; and now<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The arena swims around him&mdash;he is gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere ceased the inhuman shout which hailed the wretch who won."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Christianity, however, worked its way upwards, and at
last was professed by the emperor on his throne. Persecution
came to an end, and no more martyrs fed the
beasts in the Coliseum. The Christian emperors endeavored
to prevent any more shows where cruelty and death
formed the chief interest, and no truly religious person
could endure the spectacle; but custom and love of excitement
prevailed even against the emperor. They
went on for fully a hundred years after Rome had, in
name, become a Christian city.</p>

<p>Meantime the enemies of Rome were coming nearer
and nearer. Alaric, the great chief of the Goths, led his
forces into Italy, and threatened the city itself. Honorius,
the emperor, was a cowardly, almost idiotic boy;
but his brave general, Stilicho, assembled his forces, met
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
the Goths, and gave them a complete defeat, on Easter
day of the year 403. He pursued them to the mountains,
and for that time saved Rome.</p>

<p>In the joy of victory, the Roman Senate invited the
conqueror and his ward Honorius to enter the city in
triumph, at the opening of the new year, with the white
steeds, purple robes, and vermilion cheeks with which, of
old, victorious generals were welcomed at Rome. The
churches were visited instead of the Temple of Jupiter,
and there was no murder of the captives; but Roman
bloodthirstiness was not yet allayed, and, after the procession
had been completed, the Coliseum shows commenced,
innocently at first, with races on foot, on horseback,
and in chariots; then followed a grand hunt of
beasts turned loose in the arena; and next a sword dance.
But after the sword dance came the arraying of swordsmen,
with no blunted weapons, but with sharp spears and
swords&mdash;a gladiator combat in full earnest. The people,
enchanted, applauded with shouts of ecstasy this gratification
of their savage tastes.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, there was an interruption. A
rude, roughly robed man, bareheaded and barefooted, had
sprung into the arena, and, waving back the gladiators,
began to call aloud upon the people to cease from the
shedding of innocent blood, and not to requite God's
mercy, in turning away the sword of the enemy, by encouraging
murder. Shouts, howls, cries, broke in upon
his words; this was no place for preachings,&mdash;the old
customs of Rome should be observed,&mdash;"Back, old man!"&mdash;"On,
gladiators!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
    The gladiators thrust aside the meddler, and rushed to
the attack. He still stood between, holding them apart,
striving in vain to be heard. "Sedition! sedition!"&mdash;"Down
with him!"&mdash;was the cry; and the prefect in
authority himself added his voice. The gladiators, enraged
at interference with their vocation, cut him down.
Stones, or whatever came to hand, rained upon him from
the furious people, and he perished in the midst of the
arena! He lay dead; and then the people began to
reflect upon what had been done.</p>

<p>His dress showed that he was one of the hermits who
had vowed themselves to a life of prayer and self-denial,
and who were greatly reverenced, even by the most
thoughtless. The few who had previously seen him,
told that he had come from the wilds of Asia on a pilgrimage,
to visit the shrines and keep his Christmas at
Rome. They knew that he was a holy man&mdash;no more.
But his spirit had been stirred by the sight of thousands
flocking to see men slaughter one another, and in his simple-hearted
zeal he had resolved to stop the cruelty, or die.</p>

<p>He had died, but not in vain. His work was done.
The shock of such a death before their eyes turned the
hearts of the people; they saw the wickedness and
cruelty to which they had blindly surrendered themselves;
and since the day when the hermit died in the
Coliseum, there has never been another fight of gladiators.
The custom was utterly abolished; and one habitual
crime at least was wiped from the earth by the self-devotion
of one humble, obscure, and nameless man.</p>

<h2>THE PASSING OF ARTHUR.</h2>

<p>The reader has already become somewhat acquainted with
the marvelous history of King Arthur, and has read about the
poems and romances by which the memory of his life and
exploits have been preserved. He has also read the mythical
account of the King's last hours on earth as recorded in the
quaint old romance written by Sir Thomas Malory. Here he
may read another rendering of the same story, written in
grand and beautiful poetic form by Alfred Tennyson. In
the "Idylls of the King," Lord Tennyson has given us a
complete history of Arthur and of the brave knights and fair
ladies who lived at his court. These poems are among the
noblest ever written in our language. Turn now to the last
story in "School Reading by Grades&mdash;Fifth Year," and compare
each passage in that brief narrative with its corresponding
passage in the following poem.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">So all day long the noise of battle roll'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the mountains by the winter sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until King Arthur's Table, man by man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had fall'n in Lyonesse about their lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Arthur. Then, because his wound was deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir Bedivere, the last of all his knights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bore him to a chapel nigh the field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A broken chancel with a broken cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That stood on a dark strait of barren land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On one side lay the Ocean, and on one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay a great water, and the moon was full.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">"The sequel of to-day unsolders all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The goodliest fellowship of famous knights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sleep&mdash;the men I loved. I think that we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall never more, at any future time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walking about the gardens and the halls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Camelot, as in the days that were.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I perish by this people which I made,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' Merlin sware that I should come again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rule once more; but let what will be, be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am so deeply smitten thro' the helm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That without help I can not last till morn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In those old days, one summer noon, an arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holding the sword&mdash;and how I row'd across<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took it, and have worn it, like a king:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, wheresoever I am sung or told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In after time, this also shall be known:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now delay not: take Excalibur,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fling him far into the middle mere;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watch what thou seëst and lightly bring me word."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little thing may harm a wounded man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old knights, and over them the sea wind sang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came on the shining levels of the lake.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myriads of topaz lights, and jacinth work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of subtlest jewelry. He gazed so long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This way and that dividing the swift mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In act to throw: but at the last it seem'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There in the many-knotted waterflags,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So strode he back slow to the wounded King.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Hast thou perform'd my mission which I gave?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wild water lapping on the crag."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">Not rendering true answer, as beseem'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy fëalty, nor like a noble knight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For surer sign had follow'd, either hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or voice, or else a motion of the mere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is a shameful thing for men to lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet now I charge thee, quickly go again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then went Sir Bedivere the second time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Counting the dewy pebbles, fix'd in thought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How curiously and strangely chased, he smote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His palms together, and he cried aloud:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"And if indeed I cast the brand away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should thus be lost for ever from the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What good should follow this, if this were done?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What harm, undone? deep harm to disobey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing obedience is the bond of rule.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were it well to obey then, if a king demand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An act unprofitable, against himself?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King is sick, and knows not what he does.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What record, or what relic of my lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should be to after time, but empty breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rumors of a doubt? but were this kept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some one might show it at a joust of arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying, 'King Arthur's sword, Excalibur,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the hidden bases of the hills.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So might some old man speak in the after time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To all the people, winning reverence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now much honor and much fame were lost."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hid Excalibur the second time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so strode back slow to the wounded King.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I heard the water lapping on the crag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the long ripple washing in the reeds."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Authority forgets a dying king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid widow'd of the power in his eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In whom should meet the offices of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either from lust of gold, or like a girl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will arise and slay thee with my hands."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the bulrush beds, and clutch'd the sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strongly wheel'd and threw it. The great brand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made lightnings in the splendor of the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seen where the moving isles of winter shock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By night, with noises of the Northern Sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three times, and drew him under in the mere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lightly went the other to the King.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not tho' I live three lives of mortal men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So great a miracle as yonder hilt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when I look'd again, behold an arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three times and drew him under in the mere."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My end draws nigh; 'tis time that I were gone.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bear me to the margin; yet I fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, from the pavement he half rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remorsefully regarded thro' his tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would have spoken, but he found not words;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rising bore him thro' the place of tombs.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all the house is mute. So sigh'd the King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Muttering and murmuring at his ear, "Quick, quick!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fear it is too late, and I shall die."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothed with his breath, and looking as he walk'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Larger than human on the frozen hills.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He heard the deep behind him, and a cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before. His own thought drove him, like a goad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And barren chasms, and all to left and right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His feet on jets of slippery crag that rang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the long glories of the winter moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath them; and descending they were ware<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all the decks were dense with stately forms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream&mdash;by these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three Queens with crowns of gold&mdash;and from them rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as it were one voice, an agony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lamentation, like a wind, that shrills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All night in a waste land, where no one comes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or hath come, since the making of the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then murmur'd Arthur, "Place me in the barge."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So to the barge they came. There those three Queens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept....<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now I see the true old times are dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When every morning brought a noble chance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every chance brought out a noble knight....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now the whole Round Table is dissolved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was an image of the mighty world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, the last, go forth companionless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the days darken round me, and the years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among new men, strange faces, other minds."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And slowly answered Arthur from the barge:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The old order changeth, yielding place to new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And God fulfills himself in many ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comfort thyself; what comfort is in me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have lived my life, and that which I have done<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">May He within himself make pure! but thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou shouldst never see my face again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise like a fountain for me night and day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what are men better than sheep or goats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That nourish a blind life within the brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both for themselves and those who call them friends?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For so the whole round earth is every way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now farewell. I am going a long way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With these thou seëst&mdash;if indeed I go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the island-valley of Avilion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard lawns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where I will heal me of my grievous wound."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So said he, and the barge with oar and sail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, fluting a wild carol ere her death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revolving many memories, till the hull<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the mere the wailing died away.<br /></span>

<h2>FOR STUDY AND REFERENCE.</h2>

<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>PRINCIPLES OF GOOD READING.</h3>

<p>To become a good reader, patient and long-continued practice
is necessary. We learn to read by much reading and
never by the study of formal rules. Nevertheless, a knowledge
of the following general principles and definitions may
be of some value in assisting the learner to acquire correct
habits in the practice of oral reading.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Pronunciation.</span></h4>

<p>Under this term are included Articulation, Syllabication,
and Accent.</p>

<p>Correct articulation requires that each letter, syllable, and
word should be clearly and properly pronounced. Incorrect
articulation is the result either of careless habits or of natural
defects. In either case, it may be largely overcome by persistent
and careful drill in the pronunciation of those words
in which the greatest difficulty is experienced. Conversation,
declamation, calisthenics, singing, and similar exercises should
be engaged in, in order to assist in overcoming habits of
timidity or diffidence, and to give increased power and flexibility
to the vocal organs.</p>

<p>Syllabication and accent are learned by careful observation
and by reference, in all cases of doubt, to some standard
dictionary.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Expression.</span></h4>

<p>Correct expression in reading has reference to tone of voice,
inflection, pitch, emphasis, all of which are included under
modulation.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Tone.</span></h4>

<p>Tone, or quality of voice, is the kind of sound employed in
reading or speaking. A conversational tone is such as is used
in ordinary conversation for the expression of quiet or unemotional
thoughts. A full tone of voice is used in the expression
of high or lofty sentiments, and of feelings of joy, courage, or
exultation. A middle tone is used in the rendering of expressions
which while not conversational in character are too unimpassioned
to require a full tone. A low or subdued tone
is used in passages where the sense requires a suppression of
sound. The only rule necessary is this: <i>Study so to regulate
the tone of voice that it shall always be in harmony with the
thoughts expressed.</i></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Inflection.</span></h4>

<p>Inflection is the upward or downward movement of the
voice in speaking or reading. There are two inflections:
the <i>rising inflection</i>, in which the voice slides upward; and the
<i>falling inflection</i>, in which the voice slides downward. Sometimes
there is a union of the two inflections upon a single
sound or syllable, in order to express surprise, scorn, irony,
sorrow, or other strong or peculiar emotion. This union of
inflections is called <i>circumflex</i>. No rule for inflections can be
given which is not subject to numerous exceptions. The movement
of the voice, whether upward or downward, is in all cases
determined by the thought in the sentence. <i>That inflection
should be used which will assist to convey, in the most natural
and forcible manner, the meaning intended by the author.</i></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Pitch.</span></h4>

<p>Very closely related to tone and inflection is pitch, by which
is meant the degree of elevation of the voice. Pitch may be
<i>middle</i>, <i>high</i>, or <i>low</i>. Middle pitch is that which is used in
common conversation and in the expression of unemotional
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
thoughts. Light and joyous emotions and lively narration
require a high pitch. Passages expressing sadness, deep joy,
dignified serenity of mind, and kindred emotions, require a
low pitch. Hence, the only rule to be observed is this: <i>Let
the pitch be always in harmony with the sentiments to be expressed.</i></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Emphasis.</span></h4>

<p>Emphasis is any change of pitch, or variation of the voice,
which serves to call special attention to an important word,
syllable, or expression. The only rule that can be given for
securing correctness of emphasis is: <i>Be natural.</i> Children, in
ordinary conversation, never make mistakes in emphasis. If
they are made to understand what they are reading, have not
been permitted to imitate incorrect models, and are not hampered
by unnecessary rules, they will read as well as they
talk. Let reading be but conversation from the book, and not
only emphasis, but pitch and inflection will require but little
separate attention, and no special rules.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Pauses.</span></h4>

<p>Pauses in reading are necessary to make the meaning clear
or to assist in the proper modulation of the voice and therefore
in the correct rendering of the sentiments of the author. The
former are called grammatical pauses, and are indicated by the
marks of punctuation; the latter are called rhetorical pauses,
and depend for their correct usage upon the reader's understanding
of the thoughts which he is endeavoring to render.
In reading poetry, a slight pause is generally proper at the
end of each line, and sometimes also at the middle of each
line. The latter is called the <i>cæsural</i> pause. The object of
poetic pauses is simply to promote the melody.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
